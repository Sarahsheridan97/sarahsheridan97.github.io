         <h4>Chapter 35</h4>
      </div>
      <p>James swept the broken glass into a dustpan and deposited the shards in the metal
         garbage bin in the garage. Then he washed dishes, put away laundry, and showered.
         No
         matter what he did, Cassie’s lost expression stayed with him.</p>
      <p>He stripped, then stretched across the sofa, the volume in his earbuds loud enough
         to
         block out any thoughts of her alone and crying, but even his playlist reminded him
         of
         her. He threw the earbuds across the room. If he wanted peace, he’d have to drink
         himself to sleep.</p>
      <p>One mouthful of Jäger failed to sooth his wired brain. What the hell was he thinking,
         promising to stay away from Cassie? Was that even possible? He replaced the bottle
         and
         slammed the freezer door. He didn’t want to get drunk. What he wanted was three, maybe
         four blocks away. An easy run, even in the rain.</p>
      <p>He promised Caleb he wouldn’t touch her. He never said he wouldn’t see her.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James wiped water from his eyes and surveyed Allison’s brick two story. This may be
         daft, but after coming this far he had no intention of going back. He strode up the
         winding path and knocked.</p>
      <p>Cold air washed over him as Allison opened the door. Her eyes widened. Behind her,
         Emily’s mouth hung agape.</p>
      <p>“Is Cassie here?” Breathing hard, James braced his arms on either side of the door
         frame
         and leaned forward enough Allison backed into Emily. “Can I come in? It's raining.”</p>
      <p>He stepped inside as Cassie rounded the corner. She blinked in surprise, then checked
         through the sidelight, window accenting the door. Her gaze rested on the far wall
         before
         she spoke. “How did you get here?”</p>
      <p>“I ran.” She didn’t look happy to see him, something he hadn’t considered. “I wanted
         to
         check on you.”</p>
      <p>Allison broke into a wide grin. “You ran four blocks… in the rain… to check on Cassie.
         Caleb’s girlfriend, Cassie?”</p>
      <p>“No wonder you're soaked.” Emily pointed to his sweatshirt.</p>
      <p>Water seeped from the material and pooled in his shoes. He pulled the shirt over his
         head and mopped his chest.</p>
      <p>Three sets of eyes watched.</p>
      <p>“You don't mind that I took this off, do you?” He held the dripping garment over the
         doormat, and scanned Allison for affirmation.</p>
      <p>“She doesn’t mind.” Emily stared at his midsection. “Your shorts are wet too.”</p>
      <p>“Emily.” Allison plucked the shirt from James’ hand. “Stop trying to strip him
         naked.”</p>
      <p>He didn’t care. Cassie’s friends were free to discuss his attire and stare holes through
         him all night, if they wished. Cassie’s steady gaze pulled in his entire focus. She
         stepped toward him; arm raised. For a second it looked like she might slap him, but
         she
         tugged up the low riding waistband of his shorts.</p>
      <p>“Er...” Allison grabbed Emily’s arm and tugged her from the entrance. “We’ll put this
         in
         the dryer.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie’s hand slipped from his hip. She lifted her head, about to speak, but they
         had a
         limited amount of time, and he didn’t plan on wasting it being told what he did wrong.
         Fisting her shirt, he pulled her closer, crushing his lips against hers, his promise
         not
         to touch—forgotten.</p>
      <p>She hesitated, then wrapped her arms around him, kissing him back. He pinned her flat
         against the damask wallpaper, tension melting from his body. She wanted him. Their
         lips
         parted. He slid his hands down her arms and nestled the top of her head under his
         chin.</p>
      <p>Her contented sigh warmed the base of his throat. “You smell good.”</p>
      <p>“What do I smell like?” Between his midnight jog and stress, his body was jacked.
         He
         ought to smell like sweat.</p>
      <p>“Night air and summer rain—and you,” she said, “I love the smell of you.”</p>
      <p>He tightened his grip and kissed the top of her head, satin under his lips. His heart
         pounded like a mad drummer.</p>
      <p>She searched his face. “Where's Caleb?”</p>
      <p>The words made him step back. “At home. What went on tonight?”</p>
      <p>“He didn't tell you?”</p>
      <p>“Not exactly. He asked if something happened between us.”</p>
      <p>“What did you say?”</p>
      <p>“I said…” He paused, conflicted. “I said we had a moment when you were upset about
         him,
         and I comforted you. But that was it.” Unable to control himself, he reached out to
         play
         with her hair.</p>
      <p>“James, you said my name when some girl was trying to… to get it on with you. You
         thought she was me.”</p>
      <p>That was what he’d done? It was so stupid he almost laughed.</p>
      <p>“Did you hear me?” she said, “you said my name. You thought she was me.”</p>
      <p>“I wished she was you.” It was a heartfelt confession, but Cassie only drew her brows
         together.</p>
      <p>Heat stung his neck. “Cal’s cool,” he said, “I promised I would stay away from you.”
         He
         tried to pull her closer. “Come here, angel. Warm me up.”</p>
      <p>“This is your idea of staying away?”</p>
      <p>“Shh.” He put a finger to her lips and scanned the direction the girls went.</p>
      <p>She slapped his hand. “You said I meant nothing to you, and now you have the nerve
         to
         say you wished that girl had been me? What are you thinking?”</p>
      <p>James backed up until the opposite wall stopped him. He slumped against it. Cassie
         wanted tangible evidence of how he felt. Something he’d never be able to verbalize
         out
         loud with words.</p>
      <p>He thumped the back of his head against the wall. “What do you want me to say? That
         I
         want you to leave Cal. For me?” He could never say that. “Caleb’s my brother.”</p>
      <p>The disappointment in her features crumpled his heart.</p>
      <p>“Forget it.” Cassie crossed her arms. “This has cost me enough.”</p>
      <p>Voices neared, Allison talking loud enough to be heard before seen. The girls appeared
         around the corner, Allison in pajama pants and a robe, Emily in booty shorts and a
         cami.</p>
      <p>Emily handed James a plush purple towel. “Jeez, Cassie, why are you still in the hall?
         Aren't you going to invite him in?”</p>
      <p>Emily grabbed his hand. He glanced at Cassie, but she turned away, so he allowed Emily
         to drag him into the living room and push him onto a velvet loveseat.</p>
      <p>“Emily!” Allison’s hands rose to her cheeks. “His shorts are wet. He can't sit on
         the
         upholstery.”</p>
      <p>James tried to stand but Emily pressed his shoulder. “He’s fine, Allie. You're the
         one
         who insisted he keep his pants on.”</p>
      <p>With a groan, Allison stomped past Cassie who, appearing indifferent, hovered in the
         living room doorway.</p>
      <p>James smiled. “If you want me naked, just ask.” He had no intention of stripping naked,
         but fuck everybody who wanted to play with his head. He lifted his hips and lowered
         his
         shorts a few inches to prove his point. It would almost be worth pulling them off
         to see
         the expression on their faces.</p>
      <p>Allison returned with another towel. “Sit on this.” She handed him the furry blanket
         from the end of the sofa. Happy for the warmth, he pulled the blanket over himself.</p>
      <p>She cranked the volume on the TV and tossed him the remote. “Make yourself at home,
         James. It’s time for a girl chat.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie followed her friends into the large kitchen and leaned cross armed against
         the
         counter.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” Allison directed the question to Emily. “You promised me you’d
         mellow out.”</p>
      <p>“I know, but he looked so sad and cold.”</p>
      <p>“He’s here because of Cassie?” Allison pointed to her. “The guy ran here, in the rain,
         for her.”</p>
      <p>Cassie inspected her blush pink nail polish. James did come to see her. Although after
         their conversation, she couldn’t fathom why.</p>
      <p> “Stop staring at your manicure.” Emily glared at her. “Remind Allie that you’re into
         Caleb. You don't care what I do with James.”</p>
      <p>Cassie nodded. “I have no idea why he’s here. Emily can do whatever she wants.”</p>
      <p>“See?” Emily's smile grew. “He’s all mine.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Jeez, James,” Emily said as she slid under James’ blanket, “you’re as pale as a
         ghost.”</p>
      <p>Ignoring James’ stare, Cassie proceeded to the farthest chair. She didn’t care what
         he
         did. She gave him the opportunity to step up, and he failed. Emily could have him.</p>
      <p>“Push play, please,” Allison said, “we just started a movie.”</p>
      <p>James reached for the controller, the same time as Emily.</p>
      <p>“Sorry,” she said, her hand still on his.</p>
      <p>“It's cool.” James smiled his come-hither smile, his voice smooth. “I’ve seen this
         movie
         at least five times.” He spit out the next line on cue, proof of how well he knew
         it.
         “How ‘bout you, Cassie? Has Cal made you watch this?”</p>
      <p>Cassie kept her eyes on the screen. “We do other things.”</p>
      <p>It was the last thing he said to her. Instead, he continued spitting out line after
         line
         in such an impressive manner he became more entertaining than the movie itself. Cassie’s
         shoulders ached from tension, and so did her head. If Allison wasn’t in her pajamas,
         she’d ask for a ride home.</p>
      <p>With a few minutes left of the movie, Allison retrieved a pillow and a folded blanket.
         “Here, Cassie,” she said, “I’m going to bed. You can have the sofa—when it’s empty.”</p>
      <p>It was obvious Emily had no intention of moving anytime soon. As soon as Allison
         disappeared, Emily clicked off the table light beside her and looped her arms around
         James' neck. She pulled him downward; and he allowed it.</p>
      <p>Cassie stomped to the window. Lightning split the northern sky, but the rain had broken
         into a light drizzle. Now might be her only chance to escape.</p>
      <p>“What are you looking at her for?” Emily’s voice floated through the dark room.</p>
      <p>“Don't let me interfere.” Cassie waltzed past them. “I’m leaving.”</p>
      <p>She’d rather get struck by lightning than stay. </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
