         <h4>Chapter 13</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Smitty's turned out to be a derelict billiard hall in a part of the city dissected
         by
         train tracks. Cassie paused in front of the caged glass door. Inside appeared dark
         and
         crowded. Not someplace she wanted to be. She craved excitement, not death.</p>
      <p>She wrinkled her nose. “Why are we here?”</p>
      <p>“Relax, angel, It’s just a building.” James teased as he slipped past her to open
         the
         door. Despite the heat, he slung his leather jacket over his shoulder. He disappeared
         inside, Ron on his heels like an eager puppy.</p>
      <p>“James set this up last week,” Caleb grabbed the door handle. “I need to go keep an
         eye
         on him, we will be out of here by nine, I promise. We can go see a movie.”</p>
      <p>It was obvious Caleb would leave her on the sidewalk to make sure James was okay.
         It was
         also obvious there was nothing okay about him. Whatever he was on, left him scattered
         and manic. He may be wittier than ever, but his animated reactions freaked her out.
         Even
         his shirt was inside out.</p>
      <p>Smoke and spilled beer assaulted her nose as she followed Caleb to the bar that ran
         down
         the far wall. Caleb pulled out his wallet and motioned over the sea of red felt, for
         her
         to head to the back where James perched on top of a pool table.</p>
      <p>“You play pool, Cassie?” Ron asked, over the sound of smashing billiard balls.</p>
      <p>“I can guess the answer to that.” James reclined on the table, arms behind his head,
         legs over the side.</p>
      <p>“Hey, kid. Get off the table,” a voice boomed from the bar.</p>
      <p>Caleb appeared with a tray of plastic cups and a pitcher of dark liquid. He kissed
         her
         on the cheek as he passed, then set the tray on the tall side table where James’ jacket
         hung over the back of the lone stool.</p>
      <p>“It's pop. You think I could get served in this dive. Go figure.” He kicked James'
         dangling feet. “Get off the table. And put your shirt on the right way, for fuck's
         sakes.”</p>
      <p>James jumped down, then sauntered over to the drinks. “Yum, sugar.” With a broad smile,
         he poured himself half a glass and proceeded to take a big gulp. Pop drizzled down
         his
         chin as he gagged.</p>
      <p>He stared at the glass like it was evil. “This shites horrid. Good thing I brought
         this.” He pulled a large metal flask from his jacket pocket and filled the cup. “Here,
         Callie, for you.”</p>
      <p>Caleb racked the balls into position. He slipped the triangle into its slot then took
         a
         drink. “Holy fuck, James. Are you trying to get me shitfaced?”</p>
      <p>“Slainte, dude.” James mixed a drink for himself then poured another minus the alcohol.
         “For you.” He absentmindedly motioned in her direction.</p>
      <p>“What about me?” Looking insulted, Ron headed to the table.</p>
      <p>“Do I look like your barman?” James tossed Ron the flask and waited, hand out as Ron
         poured his shot. “Look at that, Cal. Ronnie's capable of doing something without us
         pulling his strings. Ain't that a fret?”</p>
      <p>“Asshole,” Ron mumbled, dropping the flask onto James' palm.</p>
      <p>Caleb pointed the chalked end of the cue at James. “What's with you tonight? Somethings
         going on.”</p>
      <p>“Jaysus, Cal.” James slammed his drink. “Calm your nerves. I’m trying to share a drink
         with me broham, and you think I’m up to no good.”</p>
      <p>Cassie held her breath. Just once she would like to see Caleb get fed up enough with
         James’ antics to leave.</p>
      <p>“Slainte,” Caleb said with a sigh. He raised his glass, drank half, then cheersing
         Ronnie, finished the remainder.</p>
      <p>James handed him another glass. “What are you gawking at, angel?”</p>
      <p>“Your shirt’s inside out.” She reminded him.</p>
      <p>“Go on.” He pointed to the lone chair. “Have a seat.”</p>
      <p>He dropped his cue and yanked his shirt over his head. Despite the breeze from overhead
         fans his body glistened with sweat, making him appear slippery. Not that she wanted
         to
         touch him. He pulled his shirt on the right way and picked up his stick.</p>
      <p>Being sequestered was fine by her. If Caleb planned to let his friend lead him around,
         she would rather not have anything to do with him. She pulled out her phone.</p>
      <p>Thanks to James, Caleb got drunker by the minute and nine o’clock came and went. A
         dark-haired guy with a scruffy goatee, leaned cross armed against the adjacent pool
         table. He seemed interested in the game but made no effort to approach.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to find the bathroom.” She stood and stretched. Her butt was numb from
         sitting so long.</p>
      <p>“You should go with her, Cal,” James said as she walked away.</p>
      <p>Taking James’ advice, Caleb trailed her around the tables. “Sorry about the movie,”
         he
         said when they reached the bathroom.</p>
      <p>“Its fine.” She let the bathroom door swing shut.</p>
      <p>When they returned, only Ronnie remained at the table. Caleb frowned. “Where’s
         James,”</p>
      <p>“Don’t know.” Ron lifted his gaze from the array of colored balls scattered across
         the
         worn felt. “Stop distracting me.”</p>
      <p>“I bet he went out the fire escape.” Caleb looked around. “With that dude. The one
         watching us.”</p>
      <p>Caleb was right; the guy was gone as well. Cassie sat down. James’ jacket no longer
         provided a buffer against the chair’s cool metal slats. Wherever he went, he took
         his
         coat.</p>
      <p>“Relax.” Ron continued to line up his shot. “He’s probably having a smoke in the alley.
         He's got other friends than you. Right, Cassie?”</p>
      <p>At least Ron was sober enough to deduce a logical conclusion. Even to her ears, Caleb
         sounded paranoid. “I don't see any reason to panic.” She surveyed the pool tables.
         “Except, most of these patrons look like parolees.”</p>
      <p>“You guys don’t understand.” Caleb attempted to stand the cue stick in its required
         slot. “I'm giving him a few more minutes, then I'm going to check on him.”</p>
      <p>Ron rolled his eyes. “I'm surprised you let the guy piss on his own. Although Cassie
         has
         a point. He is a pretty boy in a bar of convicts.” He took his shot. The cue ball
         connected with the eight ball, which bounced into the side pocket.</p>
      <p>“Great, Caleb.” Ron tossed his stick on the table. “You made me sink the black
         ball.”</p>
      <p>**</p>
      <p>“What do you mean there’s a price change?” James stood in the narrow alley and peered
         down at the short man he knew solely as, Leo.</p>
      <p>“The price is higher for you.” Leo curled his lips in a sneer. “Or maybe I just jump
         you
         and take your money.”</p>
      <p>Energy rolled under James’ skin, a mixture of drugs and adrenalin. He came for pills
         not
         a fight, but getting mugged, wasn’t on his bucket list. He widened his stance and
         curled
         his fingers into fists. “Nobody told me you were a thieving asshole.”</p>
      <p>Leo laughed, then swung. The first punch caught James’ cheek—and woke him up. He avoided
         another throw then at the first opening sent his left into Leo’s jaw, once, twice,
         the
         second punch hard enough to send Leo staggering backwards. Leo narrowed his eyes,
         then
         charged forward. For a minute, they grappled. Until a burning sensation sliced through
         James’ gut followed by the bizarre impression of being unzipped.</p>
      <p>Retreating to his haunches, James lowered his gaze. The black handle of a knife
         protruded from his jeans.</p>
      <p>“Jaysus.” He scrambled for a circumcision joke but couldn't brain the words out. “You
         stabbed me.”</p>
      <p>Leo’s open-mouthed stare revealed surprise at his actions. The door behind him swung
         open.</p>
      <p>“James.” Caleb’s voice rippled from another dimension.</p>
      <p>“Fuck off, Cal.” He tugged his shirt as low as it could go. He would rather die in
         this
         alley than involve Caleb in this. His shirt wasn’t long enough. Perhaps, if he got
         up
         real slow, and hid the knife’s handle with his arm, he could pull it out in the
         bathroom. He could get Cassie to help him.</p>
      <p>He thought he made it to his feet, but the ground under him sloped, pitching him
         backward. Funny, he didn't remember being on a hill. Off-kilter, he staggered abaft,
         coming to rest against the building. Rough bricks scraped his back as he slid to the
         asphalt, the world blinking around him like an old-time movie.</p>
      <p>A few feet away, Leo stood, flash frame, knees bent, about to bolt. Caleb knocked
         him
         off his feet.</p>
      <p>James licked his lips, but his sandpaper tongue refused to slide across his skin.
         Blood
         soaked his pants, spilling out around the solid blackness of the knife’s handle. His
         legs shook as if he were cold, which made no sense because he’d been roasting all
         evening.</p>
      <p>He tried to undo his pants, but his fingers were useless. His hands lay limp against
         his
         hip bones. The ringing in his ears that started off faint became so loud it blocked
         out
         all other sounds. His surroundings shifted in and out of clarity.</p>
      <p>A warm hand came down on his. “Stay still.”</p>
      <p>“Mom?” He’d been here before.</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
