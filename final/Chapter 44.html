         <h4>Chapter 44</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Cassie spent the day in her room, too nauseated to eat. By evening, when she hadn’t
         received the barrage of angry messages she’d expected from Caleb, she calmed down.
         For
         whatever reason, Elizabeth hadn’t told him.</p>
      <p>Someone knocked on her door. She kicked through the crumpled piles of journal paper,
         all
         filled with half written poetry, and headed downstairs. Caleb waited on the front
         steps.
         His fistful of pink phlox confirmed his ignorance. </p>
      <p>“I’m sorry I fell asleep on you last night.” He held the flowers out. “I was so
         hungover.”</p>
      <p>“Thanks.” Guilt churned her stomach as she took the phlox. Sleeping beside James was
         the
         antithesis of leaving him alone. But Caleb didn’t witness how sad James looked, standing
         in his bedroom.</p>
      <p>Caleb followed into the kitchen and fidgeted behind her as she retrieved a vase from
         under the sink. After stuffing it with the flowers, she faced him. “Ah…”</p>
      <p>“Don’t,” he said, finger against her lips. “Let me make yesterday up to you. Starting
         with this.” He snaked his arms around her and pulled her closer so he could reach
         her
         lips.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>He smelt like Caleb and tasted like Caleb. Neither of which were unpleasant. His lips
         were smooth; his tongue not disgusting, but foreign. She kissed back, wanting to feel
         something, but James had been right. It didn’t work that way. Not when her heart had
         wandered.</p>
      <p>Caleb pulled back, hurt evident. “What’s the matter?”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t sleep well last night,” she lied. Her heart may be residing somewhere in
         the
         twilight zone, but her brain needed to get into gear. If she broke up with Caleb,
         she’d
         be alone. James wouldn’t be there for her. Caleb made that clear.</p>
      <p>“I’m tired too.” He nodded earnestly. “Come to the pool house. James isn’t there.
         We can
         chill.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>They settled in front of the TV. Caleb’s lips and hands roamed her body, a restless
         exercise, she tried to enjoy. Eventually, they moved to the bedroom. But she couldn’t
         let him inside her. Not in a bed rumpled by James, his leather jacket hanging from
         the
         back of the chair, his sunglasses watching from the bedside table.</p>
      <p>Still on half-speed, Caleb was good about her refusal. In the end, the sun went down,
         and they fell asleep next to each other.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>Cassie's phone chirped. She reached over the edge of the bed and pulled her it from
         her
         shorts. </p>
      <p>Hey. Was all the text said.</p>
      <p>The number was nameless, and six in the morning was too early to be awake. Her phone
         sounded again. She fumbled with the volume before reading it.</p>
      <p>Meet me at Saint Ambrose in fifteen mins. I NEED to see you.</p>
      <p>Saint Ambrose; the church down the street from James. Leaning slightly, she checked
         Caleb. His eyes were shut, and he snored lightly.</p>
      <p>Who is this? she replied.</p>
      <p>A minute ticked by.</p>
      <p>James.</p>
      <p>The messages were coherent; even punctuated. He seemed sober, and he needed her. The
         phone beeped again.</p>
      <p>PLEASE</p>
      <p>Okay. She pressed send, before she could change her mind.</p>
      <p>She pulled on her shorts and tee and headed for the door. The bed creaked. Pausing,
         she
         waited for Caleb to call out to her, but the air conditioner remained the only
         sound.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James waited on the hood of his car. He appeared fine. “I wasn’t sure you’d show.”</p>
      <p>“You said you needed me.”</p>
      <p>“I do need you. I’m bored.” He sunk behind the wheel and she settled into the passenger
         seat. He paused before turning the engine over. “I also want to apologize for getting
         you caught in my bed. Elizabeth said she wouldn’t mention it and I believe her.”</p>
      <p>“You promised nobody would go in that room,” she said, though she wasn’t mad at him.
         What happened had been her fault as much as it was his.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>They headed north, cutting through the city instead of getting on the freeway. His
         Nike
         sport shorts, and crisp white polo were unusual attire.</p>
      <p>“Where are we going?” Her words seemed to wake him up.</p>
      <p>He turned onto Lakeshore drive. “You’ll see.”</p>
      <p>“So…” he glanced at her, “what did you end up doing yesterday?”</p>
      <p>“Not much.” She couldn’t tell James where she’d spent last night, no more than she
         could
         tell Caleb where she’d slept the night before. It was official, she’d entered nowhere
         land. Purgatory.</p>
      <p>She nudged his hand, resting on the shifter. “What did you do?”</p>
      <p>“I got drunk, then laid. In that order.” He tossed her a glance. “I won’t lie about
         it.”</p>
      <p>She snatched her hand back. “Is that why you needed to see me? To tell me?”</p>
      <p>“No. But I’m being honest. It meant fuck all, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>She could relate. Last night’s make out session with Caleb, meant nothing. No matter
         how
         hard she tried, she couldn’t resurrect her desire. It vanished, or maybe it never
         existed.</p>
      <p>They were no longer on Lakeshore Drive, and somewhere above the city. Ritzy shops
         lined
         the streets along with upscale eateries. James turned into a smooth parking lot.</p>
      <p>“We’re here,” he said, pulling into a spot that overlooked the green expanse of a
         golf
         course.</p>
      <p>Here turned out to be a roaming mid-century building, housing a country club. James
         dug
         two short-handled racquets from the trunk and gave her one.</p>
      <p>“You want to play racquetball?” she asked, holding the racquet at arm’s length.</p>
      <p>“I want to spend friend time with you. Sober time. Me and you. Understand?”</p>
      <p>She got it. She was worth his effort to remain sober; his way of saying she meant
         something to him.</p>
      <p>“Walk, luv,” he said from up ahead. “I promise I won’t do anything unfriendly to you.
         At
         least not on the court.”</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Racquetball translated into an acceptable way for him to spend the morning with his
         arms
         wrapped around her. He demonstrated the high lob serve, the drive Z serve, and the
         correct way to pivot to increase her stroke strength.</p>
      <p>Exhausted, she plopped down cross-legged on the edge of the mat. “I think this has
         been
         your excuse to grope me, but I’ll give you points for creativity.” She casually reached
         for his phone. The last message he received had been from Emily.</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to search my phone. I’ll tell you anything you want to know.” He tossed
         the green ball into the air and caught it, before whacking it against the wall.</p>
      <p>She set the device down. Watching James was more fun than snooping, especially when
         snooping held the potential to burn.</p>
      <p>After another round, he dropped beside her and mopped the wet hair from his face.
         He
         stared across the few feet that separated them.</p>
      <p>“This is bullshit,” he said after a moment. “Let’s go home.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Despite the lack of communication in the car, it didn’t take long for her to figure
         out
         home meant his place. He snugged the Mustang against the house and cut the engine.
         “Are
         you okay to be here?”</p>
      <p>“I have no other plans.”</p>
      <p>“You know what I mean.” He gave her a pointed look. “Caleb must be awake by now.”</p>
      <p>“I’m good,” she said.</p>
      <p>She had time. She would make time. Same thing.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>She waited on James’ unmade bed while he went into the bathroom. The faucet turned
         on. A
         few seconds later, he appeared shirtless in the doorway.</p>
      <p>“I’m gonna clean up.” He stepped out of his shorts and grinned before disappearing
         around the corner.</p>
      <p>The lure was too strong, she was too weak, or the fates too determined. She got off
         the
         bed and walked into the bathroom.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James maintained his silence when she entered, even as she removed her clothing and
         climbed into the opposite end of the tub. He finished soaping, then submerged, leaving
         his hair to float on the ripples. When he rose, he closed his eyes and stretched his
         legs beside her, ankles resting on the tubs edge.</p>
      <p>Now that she knew about the abuse, she no longer saw tattoos, just carnage. She kissed
         her fingers and touched his shin. “You’re quiet,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Thinking.”</p>
      <p>“About what?”</p>
      <p>“You’re in my tub. We must be close friends.”</p>
      <p>A hot flush burnt through her, and the heat of the water didn’t help. She rose to
         sit on
         the rim.</p>
      <p>“Is it too hot?” He splashed his feet into the water and leaned forward. “I can add
         some
         cold. I tend to like my water too hot for anyone else.”</p>
      <p>Anyone else? Did he bring the girl he slept with here? Emily? She reached for a towel,
         but he intercepted her hand. “Don't cover up. You’re beautiful. I love the way your
         hair
         twists and how pink your cheeks are.”</p>
      <p>He kissed her knee, then placed a few slow kisses upward, along her inner thigh.</p>
      <p>She brought her hands between her legs. “What are you doing?”</p>
      <p>“Renegotiating our friend arrangement.” He flicked the inside of her leg with his
         tongue. “Consider this a rebellion.”</p>
      <p>“Stop it.” Even the idea of his intentions made her want to lock her ankles
         together.</p>
      <p>He rested his chin against her knee and smiled his most charming smile, the one she
         knew
         got him what he wanted, and trailed a finger down her calf. “Let me taste you. I’m
         not
         used to begging, but I’m sure I can be quite convincing.”</p>
      <p>She didn’t want him begging. Did she?</p>
      <p>His eyes darkened. He rose to his knees, his face inches from hers. “I gave you five
         minutes to examine me. I’m asking for half that time.”</p>
      <p>He didn’t seem to care that he was on full display, and she never wanted anyone so
         bad.
         What did that say about her? Her mother would have a word for it.</p>
      <p>“I'm new to this,” she said. “It's scary.”</p>
      <p>“I was new to that. Lips on me… there. Don’t think I wasn’t scared.”</p>
      <p>“Are you new to this?” She had to ask.</p>
      <p>He pressed his forehead against hers then inched back. “There's that jealous streak.
         No.
         I'm not new to this, in fact, I'm quite good at it.”</p>
      <p>How many girls had he done this to? A vision of his head between someone else’s legs
         made her want to cry. Especially if that someone had been Emily.</p>
      <p>“You shouldn’t ask questions you don’t want answers to.” He removed her hands from
         between her legs and placed them on the rim, then sunk into the water, his breath
         steamy
         on her inner thigh. “Relax, Angel.”</p>
      <p>Relax? While he was there? Impossible. She splayed her fingers across the tub’s smooth
         acrylic surface in search of security. Then his hand knotted around hers, and heat
         filled her insides.</p>
      <p>After a minute, she didn’t have to try to relax. She peeked between her lashes, the
         visual as much of a turn on as the feeling. She shut her eyes and gave in to the
         sensations.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>When she opened her eyes, James reclined against his end of the tub. A smug grin spread
         across his face.</p>
      <p>She slid into the water. “You look pretty impressed with yourself. Like you said,
         you've
         had lots of practice.”</p>
      <p>His smile faded. He closed the gap between them, drawing her between his knees. “From
         the first time I saw you, I couldn’t get you out of my head. Only you have been here,”
         he motioned around the room, then placed her hand over his heart, “and only you have
         been here. That counts for something, right?”</p>
      <p>His eyes sparkled, sincere and warm. He brought her hand to his lips and sucked on
         her
         fingertips. When he got to her pinky, his eyes met hers.</p>
      <p>“What I don't get is you never seem concerned about Cal's past, or even his present,
         for
         that matter. But you’re all over me. It bugs the shit out of you when I’m with other
         girls.” His expression grew serious. “It's not just the physical stuff that freaks
         you
         out, though. You're possessive of my head. I can feel you trying to get in. You want
         to
         know everything about me.”</p>
      <p>She wasn’t jealous of Caleb. Spurned maybe, but not get your hands off my man, jealous.
         She’d even let the Amber thing slide. She’d been more hurt Caleb lied to her than
         insane
         he was with another girl. But she wanted to know James inside and out.</p>
      <p>Her eyes filled with tears. Did he always have to be so correct?</p>
      <p>“Hey.” His expression fell. “It's okay. You're welcome to my head, but it's sort of
         messed up in there.”</p>
      <p>She backed away. “I have no rights to you. I don't know why I'm so possessive.”</p>
      <p>Water splashed as he pulled her closer, so her head rested against his chest. He
         tightened his legs around her. “We don't have to analyze our arrangement right now.”</p>
      <p>But they weren’t allowed an arrangement. Caleb said being with her would kill James.
         Despite the heat, she shivered.</p>
      <p>“Christ, Cassie. The water’s plenty hot and you're shivering.”</p>
      <p>She gave him a tiny shove. “I’m not cold. In fact, I need to cool down. You need to
         cool
         down.”</p>
      <p>“I’m past cooling down.”</p>
      <p>His sultry tone made his intentions clear and goosebumps rose across her skin. “Why
         are
         we always in water?”</p>
      <p>“That's an easy fix.” He stepped out of the tub. “Come here.”</p>
      <p>She rose gradually and stood beside him. To her surprise, he scooped her up. “James,”
         she protested, but he carried her the short distance and laid her on the bed.</p>
      <p>“Open your eyes, angel.” He kissed the tip of her nose. “We’re officially out of the
         bathroom.”</p>
      <p>“And getting your sheets wet.”</p>
      <p>“I have a dryer.” He kissed her collarbone, sucking in her skin—soft—then harder.</p>
      <p>She pushed his head away. “Don’t give me a hickey.”</p>
      <p>“Don't worry,” he said after a few seconds, voice cooler. “I understand the drill.”
         He
         continued kissing her, moving to her breasts. He latched down on one, hard.</p>
      <p>“Damn.” Not expecting teeth, she jumped.</p>
      <p>He caught her hand and kept it. Something changed in him, but she allowed him to settle
         between her legs and bucked her hips to meet his, craving to close the distance between
         them.</p>
      <p>“Patience, Cassandra.” He laced his fingers through hers.</p>
      <p>He was taking his time, too much time, and he’d called her Cassandra. Still, she wiggled
         under him, not wanting another second to go by without feeling him inside her. He
         pressed his face to hers, his breath hot, and gave her what she wanted.</p>
      <p>The heat of his body spiraled her into a void where it didn’t matter if she hurt him,
         hurt Caleb, or hurt herself. She wrapped her legs around him, not wanting to let go.</p>
      <p>Something warm dripped onto her cheeks. She inched back and opened her eyes. Tears
         clumped his lashes together.</p>
      <p>“I think I’m in love with you,” he said, his own eyes shut. Another tear dropped on
         her
         cheek before he buried his head in her shoulder.</p>
      <p>She tightened her free arm around him, wanting to say she might love him too, but
         he
         hushed her with his lips and rocked against her, squeezing her fingers so hard they
         hurt. Until he stopped moving and tried to back out</p>
      <p>“Don’t go.” She held him tighter. “Please.”</p>
      <p>That bit of ownership, no matter how false, was worth anything. He must have wanted
         it
         too because he stopped fighting and relaxed, filling her with tiny pulsing sensations.
         She collapsed under him, blinking away her own tears.</p>
      <p>She had been with two different people, and both made her cry. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
