      </div>
      <p>James slid into the passenger seat of Caleb’s car. After a few blocks, it became evident
         Caleb was in no hurry to tell him what happened.</p>
      <p>“If you plan on giving me the silent treatment, let me out here.” He grasped the door
         handle.</p>
      <p>“Don’t even think about bailing on me.” Caleb’s voice contained ice. “You’re coming
         to
         the pool house.”</p>
      <p>James closed his eyes. That gave him fifteen minutes to straighten his thoughts from
         the
         pills he’d consumed. Once the fog lifted, he’d deal with wherever this was headed.</p>
      <p>The familiar curb bump signaled their arrival. James made quick work of the door handle,
         then, to buy time, stopped to pee on the pink phlox alongside the fence.</p>
      <p>“Must you use the entire world as your toilet?” Caleb waited in the open doorway.
         “You’ll kill those, and Mom will be mad.”</p>
      <p>“You’re still referring to her as my mom.” James slunk past, into the pool house.
         “You
         can’t be that angry with me, then.” He turned the TV on. As a peace offering, he
         extended the remote over the chair arm.</p>
      <p>Caleb scoffed. “Your crazy mother may have kept you tied up, so you didn’t learn what
         manners are, but my mother would like her flowers to live.”</p>
      <p>The remote slipped from James’ grasp. It landed, a soft thud on the carpet as he shrank
         back.</p>
      <p>“Fuck.” Caleb groaned. “Forget I said that.”</p>
      <p>James could only nod. For a second he was cuffed to a bed post in darkness so
         suffocating he would beg for a beating instead. He pushed the thought away, back into
         hiding, and gripped the arm rest. Who knew what would come out of Cal’s mouth next.
         But
         Caleb remained focused on the television, his body taut.</p>
      <p>It seemed all they did was squabble these days.</p>
      <p>Minutes passed. The silence fueled his memories of days alone, the nights blending.
         At
         least the beatings were faster. If his fingers weren’t dug into the upholstery, he’d
         float to the ceiling. He couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>
      <p>“I'm sorry,” James choked out, “for whatever and everything I've done, tonight and
         my
         entire effing life. I apologize. Talk to me. Please.”</p>
      <p>“You want me to talk?” Caleb clicked the TV off. “What’s going on between you and
         Cassie?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t…” James swallowed. Everything he should say would be a lie. “I mean… It’s
         not…”</p>
      <p>With each broken sentence, more color faded from Caleb’s cheeks. He lifted his hand.
         “Stop. I don't want to hear anything that will make me hate you.”</p>
      <p>“Don't say that, Callie.”</p>
      <p>“Do you like her?” Caleb stared at him. “Do you understand what it means to like someone
         as opposed to using them?”</p>
      <p>“I'm not that fucked-up. I understand what liking someone means.” He did, didn’t he?
         He
         could feel stuff. He may have a dissociative disorder; but he wasn’t a psychopath.
         Cassie knew that. She believed in him.</p>
      <p>“I like her, okay.” It was strange to admit out loud. “It's a bit of a surprise to
         me,
         too.”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s eyes widened. “Are you sober?”</p>
      <p>“Feck off, Cal. I haven’t drank all day.”</p>
      <p>Caleb sighed, long and heavy. “I realize I fooled around on her, so you’ll think I’m
         full of shit, but I like her too. This summer wasn't supposed to go down like this.”</p>
      <p>Deep lines appeared on Caleb’s forehead. He narrowed his eyes. “Cassie knew stuff
         about
         you. Stuff only I know. Stuff she shouldn’t know unless…”</p>
      <p>James winced. Knowing what was coming didn’t make it easier. “Just ask it already,
         for
         Christ’s sake.”</p>
      <p>“Did you fuck her?”</p>
      <p>“No. You can relax.”</p>
      <p>“Relax? I’m supposed to be relieved you managed to keep your dick out of my girlfriend?”
         Caleb’s cheeks flushed. “Did you let her touch you?”</p>
      <p>Heat crawled up the back of James’ neck. He pressed his lips together.</p>
      <p>“Oh, no fucking way, James. Don't give me that cryptic look, not after what I went
         through tonight. Has she touched you? I can guess the answer, but I want to hear it
         from
         you.”</p>
      <p>James nodded. Lying would be pointless. His face was on fire and Caleb could read
         him
         too well.</p>
      <p>“Fucking perfect.” Caleb seemed to recoil into himself. “You let in my girlfriend.
         Do
         you have shit for brains?” He lowered his head into his hands.</p>
      <p>James put his hand over his mouth and pressed hard. There was nothing he could do
         or say
         to make this better.</p>
      <p>Cal’s eyes were wet when he looked up. “Are you trying to hurt me? You’re supposed
         to be
         my brother.”</p>
      <p>“I won’t touch her again.” The words popped out of James’ mouth before he could process
         what they meant. “She was hurt, the night you didn’t show at that party—and started
         drinking. That pretty much nullifies everything, doesn’t it?”</p>
      <p>He broke the confines of the chair and leapt to his feet, so quickly Caleb jerked
         back.
         The bottle of Jäger he’d stashed was still behind a stack of old DVDs. He gulped a
         drink.</p>
      <p>Caleb eyed him from the sofa, brows raised.</p>
      <p>Wherever he went, people dissected him. Except Cassie. She accepted him, no questions
         asked. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Stop examining me.”</p>
      <p>“I can’t believe you let her touch you.” Caleb sighed. “I'd be ecstatic—if we weren’t
         talking about my girlfriend.”</p>
      <p>James set the bottle in front of Caleb and paced into the kitchen.</p>
      <p>“I thought you hated her,” Caleb said, “you didn’t even want her around.”</p>
      <p>“Why are we still discussing this?”</p>
      <p>“Oh. I get it.” Caleb took a drink then placed the bottle in the freezer. “You didn't
         want her around because you liked her—not because you hated her.”</p>
      <p>James picked up the lacrosse ball from the top of a mesh basket of assorted sports
         equipment. He bounced it hard against the wall. No matter which way this conversation
         went, he’d lose.</p>
      <p>“Wow,” Caleb huffed. “At least some of your comments make sense now.”</p>
      <p>He whipped the ball again. It smashed into a picture of dogs playing pool, sending
         glass
         everywhere. He resumed pacing, but his knees were spongy.</p>
      <p>“Calm down.” Caleb stepped in front of him, his voice laced with the worried tone
         James
         found comforting and aggravating. “Don't freak out.”</p>
      <p>James pushed past. “Stop worrying about me. I'm not some fragile nut case.”</p>
      <p>“You’re acting like one.”</p>
      <p>Sighing, James plopped onto the sofa.</p>
      <p>Caleb sat beside him. “Remember when you first moved in with us?”</p>
      <p>Tracing circles on his knee, he nodded. He had no idea where this was headed, but
         anywhere away from the current topic would work.</p>
      <p>“Mom kept that journal. She was always watching you for signs of suicidal behavior.”</p>
      <p>Those days burnt holes in James’ memory. He’d been haunted back then. He would
         disappear, sending Caleb’s mom into waves of panic until they found him hiding in
         some
         random closet—and Cal would climb in and sit beside him.</p>
      <p>He groaned. “Go to feckin hell, Callie. I’m not gonna kill myself over a girl.” But
         it
         wasn’t cool his current behavior reminded Cal of his darkest days.</p>
      <p>“Bros before hoes,” he spat the words out before he could change his mind. “I said
         I
         won’t touch her.”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s eyebrows lifted. “We're not in middle school anymore. This is too serious
         to be
         summed up in a cliché.”</p>
      <p>“No. It’s not. Family comes first.” He reached over to knuckle-bump Caleb.</p>
      <p>Grunting, Caleb complied. “What do we do now? No one gets her?”</p>
      <p>“Nah. You like her, she likes you.” He spoke fast, wanting to be done with it. “You’re
         the one who cultivated this all summer. Besides, she doesn't want me. Girls never,
         you
         know, really want me.”</p>
      <p>“But you're into her. That’s a first.”</p>
      <p>“I may like her a bit,” James allowed. He walked to the window and stared into the
         blackness. “But all I did was console her over you.”</p>
      <p>He picked up his tortured expression in the reflection of the glass, then Caleb’s
         image
         behind him, looking skeptical.</p>
      <p>Caleb shook his head. “You’re sure you’re okay?”</p>
      <p>“I’m always okay.” Unable to face Caleb, he lit a smoke. “You were right. I ruined
         this
         for you.”</p>
      <p>“When did I say that?”</p>
      <p>“At that shoot. When you told me about, Cassie.” The words haunted him.</p>
      <p>Caleb held his fingers up, requesting the smoke, then took a long pull. “I don’t
         remember that, and you haven’t ruined anything.”</p>
      <p>James lit another cigarette. “Am I forgiven?”</p>
      <p>“Forgiven.” Caleb shifted. “How much does Cassie know about you? Give me a heads
         up.”</p>
      <p>“Some.” James shrugged. “Not much. Maybe you should tell her.”</p>
      <p>“Tell her what?”</p>
      <p>“What a fuck up I am. She’d never speak to me again, which would solve a lot of
         problems.”</p>
      <p>Caleb stubbed his cigarette out. “You're not fucked-up—and I'm out of answers. I'm
         going
         to bed. My brain’s scrambled.”</p>
      <p>“Cassie looked really upset.” James turned back to the window. “Are you going to call
         her?”</p>
      <p>“Not tonight, but yeah. Thanks for being okay with it.” The door clicked shut.</p>
      <p>“No problem,” James said to no one. He pressed his forehead against the cool glass
         and
         shut his eyes. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
