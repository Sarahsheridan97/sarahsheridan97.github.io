      <p>Cassie kept her eyes on her Instagram’s poetry page. She wrote under the name, Cassandra
         but considered changing it to, Cassandra Angel. Her latest poem received fifteen
         likes.</p>
      <p>“Have fun last night?” James asked, as he rummaged through a clean basket of folded
         clothing. “You went out with your dad, right?”</p>
      <p>She looked up in surprise. “My dad was distracted,” she said, wanting to forget the
         evening’s events. Especially her parents’ hushed fight that lasted late into the
         morning. “He has a lot on his mind.”</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t lying.” James slung a black t-shirt over his shoulder. “She’s not my
         girlfriend.”</p>
      <p>“She?” Cassie scoffed. “As in Alexa? It's none of my business.” She went back to her
         poetry.</p>
      <p>“I'm clarifying. I told you she wasn't, and I don't want you to think I was spoofing
         you.”</p>
      <p>She stared at her phone, though Instagram blurred before her. Why would James care
         if
         she pegged him for a liar?</p>
      <p>“See ya,” he said, waiting in the open door. But there was no way in hell she’d look
         at
         him.</p>
      <p>The click of the latch told her it was safe to lift her eyes.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>James reappeared much later, balancing two plates of food and a bowl of fruit. How
         he
         managed to get into the pool house without dropping anything was beyond her. She
         considered helping but Caleb lay, asleep on her arm.</p>
      <p>They tried to make out, but her heart wasn’t in it. She couldn’t get the image of
         blanket-clad Alexa out of her head, and worse, Alexa never went anywhere without her
         posse of friends.</p>
      <p>“Wake up.” James kicked the end of the sofa. “Mom said, you need to eat,” he mimicked
         Elizabeth’s mothering tone.</p>
      <p>The smell of bacon wafted from the plates as James arranged the food on the bistro
         table. He dropped into a chair and smiled wide as he surveyed his work.</p>
      <p>“BLTs,” he confirmed. “I helped make them.</p>
      <p>With a groan, Caleb slowly roused into an upright position. He muted the TV then
         stumbled to the chair opposite James. “Thanks, bro. I’m famished.” He glanced at her.
         “Want a banana?”</p>
      <p>“No thanks.” Her mouth watered for bacon. She massaged her arm and concentrated on
         trying to read Drew Carey’s muted lips. Her stomach growled.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, Cassie,” James apologized from the table. “I didn’t mention you were here.
         I
         wanted to avoid the cross-examination.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t worry about it.” She drew her knees to her chin and closed her eyes. Last night’s
         lack of sleep didn’t help her mood.</p>
      <p>The sofa jiggled and she opened her eyes to James, perched on the far end. She was
         about
         to suggest he would be less likely to wear his food if he ate at the table when he
         shoved his plate toward her.</p>
      <p>“Here.” He removed half the sandwich and motioned to the rest with his chin.</p>
      <p>She shot Caleb a look. He should be the one offering her food. His eyebrows pulled
         together—briefly—then he took another bite of his sandwich.</p>
      <p>Cassie pulled the fork out of a potato and stared at it.</p>
      <p>“Don't worry,” James said, “you can't catch what I have from a fork.”</p>
      <p>“Have you been tested since last night?” She fought the desire to wipe the utensil
         off
         and tasted the salad. It was good. She finished it in a couple of mouthfuls and started
         on the sandwich.</p>
      <p>Caleb pushed his empty plate away. He laced his hands behind his head and tipped the
         chair on its hind legs. The bottom of his green polo hovered above his board shorts,
         exposing an inch of tanned skin. Hot, even in her sour mood.</p>
      <p>“What’s going on today?” he asked, “I’m open to suggestions.”</p>
      <p>James thumped his feet onto the coffee table, hard enough to knock the top pizza box
         to
         the floor. “Don’t you have school or an assignment to do, Cassandra?” He smiled wide.
         “That shite must take you twice as long.”</p>
      <p>It was a nice reminder, despite sharing his food, James was still an asshole. She
         glared
         at him.</p>
      <p>“Why do you have to be such a dick?” Caleb said from the table.</p>
      <p>“I’m not being a dick.” James held his hands up. “She’s so busy with you, I’m concerned
         she’s falling behind.”</p>
      <p>“It's Sunday, James.” Cassie set her plate beside the remaining pizza box. “If you
         stayed sober long enough, you’d realize that.”</p>
      <p>Instead of getting mad, James laughed. “Jesus, Cal. Your gash just called me a
         pisshead.”</p>
      <p>“I have no idea what you just said.” She looked to Caleb for help, but he had laid
         his
         forehead against the table. She picked the pizza box off the floor and tossed it onto
         the sofa. “This place is destroyed. How many girls were here last night? No doubt
         one
         for each of you.”</p>
      <p>Her voice had taken on the bitchy quality her mother used, and Caleb resembled a deer
         in
         the headlights when he lifted his head. But she didn’t care. He needed to stop getting
         sucked into James' constant state of debauchery.</p>
      <p>“No one was here but me, Ronnie, and Alexa,” James answered for Caleb.</p>
      <p>She spun to face him. “Like I can believe you.”</p>
      <p>“What’s the big deal.” Caleb waved her off. “Alexa comes to see James, not me.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, relax, angel.” James grinned. “I confess. I got laid last night. I’ll give
         you a
         play-by-play if it’s your heart's desire.”</p>
      <p>She wanted to erase his wicked grin with her fist. Whose side would Caleb be on if
         she
         did? She doubted it would be hers.</p>
      <p>James blinked innocently. “Cal didn't do anything wrong—and you don't care who I
         screw—do you?”</p>
      <p>“Of course not,” she said, but her cheeks heated.</p>
      <p>“So.” James smiled. “what’s your effing problem?”</p>
      <p>She didn’t know what her problem was. With no proof of Caleb being unfaithful, she
         had
         no reason to be this angry, but her thumping pulse told her mad was exactly what she
         was.</p>
      <p>James raised his brows in expectation of an answer, but Caleb narrowed his, like he
         searched for something just out of his line of vision. Self-conscious, she turned
         her
         back to them. A layer of dust covered the piano. She stepped toward it. “Why don't
         you
         guys impress me with your supposed musical ability.” They were so arrogant, there
         was no
         way they could be good at everything.</p>
      <p>A pile of song books sat stacked on the piano’s lid. The top one read, Complete Piano
         Works for Four Hands. She grabbed it sending tiny specks of dust to float in the
         sunlight. A bright blue booklet, Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin slipped out.
         Ominous black notes cluttered the bars, making it appear difficult.</p>
      <p>“I keep hearing you can play anything.” She waved the book at them. “Prove it.”</p>
      <p>Caleb slid his chair back. “You want us to play, Rhapsody?” He rolled his eyes.</p>
      <p>“That piece is written as a duet,” James said, though he barely glanced at it. “But
         you
         don't need four hands to play it, and I can't stand Gershwin. Knock it out yourself,
         Cal. Show her.”</p>
      <p>James had lost his smug grin and sounded scared. Perfect. She set Rhapsody on the
         rack.
         “Come on,” she chided, “impress me.”</p>
      <p>“James can do the intro on the clarinet,” Caleb offered. “I’ll play the piano.”</p>
      <p>What was their problem? “I want to hear you play piano. Together.”</p>
      <p>“We don't play together, anymore.” Caleb threw James a glance, then moved toward the
         piano. “I haven't touched the piano since I picked up the guitar.”</p>
      <p>“Liars.” Vindicated, Cassie smiled, but her stomach began to hurt. “You can’t play
         everything. Just like you’re lying about who was here last night.” She wasn’t an idiot.
         They could have had an orgy for all she knew.</p>
      <p>Caleb pointed at her. “You’re going to eat those words.”</p>
      <p>From the sofa, James choked out a strangled laugh. He slouched over, head in his
         hands.</p>
      <p>“Come on.” Caleb lifted the fall and trailed his fingers across the keys. Music filled
         the room as he warmed-up. “Don’t let her call us liars. You can play primo.”</p>
      <p>“What the fuck, Cal?” James shook his head but sat on Caleb’s right. He remained rigid,
         while Caleb’s fingers slid lucidly across the keys.</p>
      <p>Caleb continued to practice. “I miss playing piano with you. You remember how,
         right?”</p>
      <p>Curious, she moved to Caleb’s side and leaned against the wall to face them.</p>
      <p>Caleb bumped James’ shoulder. “Dude. Chill. It’s one song.”</p>
      <p>James lifted his fingers. Sweat glistened on his brow as he played a short sequence.
         He
         inhaled, puffed out his cheeks, and went over the same notes.</p>
      <p>Cassie leaned closer, elbows resting on the top of the piano. Her gaze met James’
         and
         held, until he broke away to stare at Rhapsody’s notes. From his glazed expression,
         it
         was obvious he saw right through them. A bead of sweat rolled down his cheek.</p>
      <p>“It's okay,” Cassie backpaddled. Nothing about the way James looked was normal. “You
         can
         stop. I was joking, anyway.”</p>
      <p>“Screw you both,” James said, without looking up.</p>
      <p>He hit a sequence of notes, which must have been the intro because Caleb stopped what
         he
         was doing and waited, his long fingers poised. Then they were off, in synchronicity,
         each note complimenting the other. Cassie stared open-mouthed. The boastful pianist
         for
         their church choir back in Kansas didn't come close to sounding like that. Four hands
         on
         the keyboard made the instrument come alive.</p>
      <p>The music was beautiful and for a few seconds, perfect. Then James pulled his fingers
         off the keys, leaving Caleb’s notes to sputter midair, alone, and sad.</p>
      <p>James sat for a second before slamming the fall, giving Caleb just enough time to
         move
         his hands.</p>
      <p>“James.” Caleb kept his eyes downward. “I'm sorry.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever.” James’ gaze swung to her. “Hope you impressed your girlfriend.” He scrambled
         off the bench and headed for the door.</p>
      <p>“Wait.” Caleb jumped up. The bench hit the floor. Its hoard of songbooks spewed out
         from
         under its hinged seat. “Jesus.” Caleb kicked its wooden frame.</p>
      <p>Cassie gaped at the open doorway. James was gone. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
