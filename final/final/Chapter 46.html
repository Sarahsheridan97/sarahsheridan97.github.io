         <h4>Chapter 46</h4>
      </div>
      <p>James stared at the ceiling. What was wrong with him? No matter what his heart said,
         Cassie was Caleb’s girlfriend, not his. Physical proof of that shouldn't rattle him
         like
         it did. It was a hickey on her neck. Hell, there were worse places he could have
         discovered one.</p>
      <p>He stuck the bottle between his legs and unscrewed the lid with his good hand. Bacardi.
         The liquid burned, but he gulped down half. A lot, even for him. With Caleb tangled
         up
         in Cassie, no one would stop him. They were probably snuggled together this very
         moment.</p>
      <p>He told Cassie he loved her. What the hell did he know about love?</p>
      <p>Forgetting—that, he was good at.</p>
      <p>After the first few gulps his throat stopped protesting and the alcohol tasted better.
         He lit another blunt then gave the coffee table a savage kick. It landed on its top
         with
         a loud thump. One of its legs toppled over in an anti-climactic finale.</p>
      <p>Kicking it wasn’t as cathartic as he’d hoped, and he’d crushed his cigar box.</p>
      <p>He set the Bacardi on the floor, a challenging task with the rum kicking in, then
         booted
         the table against the wall instead of righting it. It splintered into an unfixable
         mess.</p>
      <p>His drug paraphernalia lay scattered across the floor. Dropping down, he bumped the
         sofa
         back. A pill bottle peeked out from under the upholstered skirt. The opaque container
         rattled when he shook it.</p>
      <p>He didn’t bother reading the label. It didn't matter. There ought to be enough of
         them
         to knock him on his ass until tomorrow night, or school started, if he was lucky.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Cassie stretched against Caleb under the blanket on the pool house sofa. He didn’t
         press
         for details. Instead, he chose to close the curtains and play soft music. If he was
         trying to soothe her, it worked. She drifted to sleep, settled against his ribs.</p>
      <p>When she woke again, it was late afternoon. Rain pelted the windows and hammered the
         roof. What was James doing now? Was he somewhere warm and dry? A loud growl escaped
         her
         stomach, a reminder she hadn’t eaten.</p>
      <p>“Hungry?” Caleb whispered in her ear. “I told my mom you weren’t feeling well, so
         she
         made her famous soup.”</p>
      <p>Cassie shuffled to the window and stared into the gloomy day. Elizabeth probably wanted
         to poison her. She would have to explain, in front of Caleb, how she ended up in the
         upstairs bedroom—with James.</p>
      <p>Her day couldn’t get much worse.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Both Caleb’s parents were in the kitchen. Great. She hardly met his father and he’d
         get
         to witness her humiliation. But Elizabeth didn’t launch into a rant about the previous
         morning. Smiling, she abandoned her place at the stove to grab the blanket they used
         as
         an umbrella.</p>
      <p>“Cassie.” David’s knife rhythmically thudded against their Illinois-shaped chopping
         board. “We heard you were under the weather, so Elizabeth whipped up a batch of chicken
         soup.” His voice held no disgust, only concern.</p>
      <p>Cassie pushed one of the stools closer to Caleb, then slouched against him. Elizabeth
         didn’t tell anyone what she saw. James had been right.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth gave Caleb an affectionate hug, then laid the back of her hand across Cassie’s
         forehead. “I hope nothing bad happened?”</p>
      <p>“Just an argument with my mom.” Cassie stared at the marble top. “Caleb shouldn’t
         have
         mentioned it.”</p>
      <p>He shrugged. “I thought the soup would help. It always makes James better. Or maybe
         it's
         the way my mom babies him when he's sick.”</p>
      <p>“James needs to be babied sometimes,” Elizabeth said in her soft tone reserved for
         James. She placed a steamy bowl on the marble. “Go ahead, Cassie. Try some broth.”</p>
      <p>The soup was hot, but good, with the perfect amount of seasoning. She consumed a few
         mouthfuls when Caleb’s phone vibrated. She forced herself to swallow.</p>
      <p>“What’s up.” Caleb offered his usual guy greeting.</p>
      <p>“Is that your brother?” Elizabeth said, “ask him if he’s hungry.”</p>
      <p>Caleb waved her off. “I can’t hear you,” he said into the phone, then hopped off the
         stool and paced across the kitchen. He faced the wall, the palm of his hand against
         his
         ear. “I’ve got to go,” he said when he turned around.</p>
      <p>David looked up from stirring his sauce. "What’s going on?”</p>
      <p>“James’ car broke down. I have to get him.” He pulled his keys from the hook and rushed
         out of the kitchen.</p>
      <p>Cassie remained on the stool. James probably got busted for drinking and driving and
         needed a bailout. She would be the last person he wanted to see.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for the soup.” Her spongy knees felt weak as she left the kitchen, after
         Caleb.</p>
      <p>He waited in the front entrance, his thumbs flying over his phone. “Get in the car,”
         he
         said, when she approached. “I might need your help.”</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>“Fucking, James.” Caleb punched the steering wheel. “He's completely out of it. I
         couldn't understand a word he said.”</p>
      <p>The first tinges of fear tightened her lungs. “Is he alright?”</p>
      <p>“He’s scared, Cassie.” Sweat glistened on Caleb’s temple. “Scared enough to call
         me.”</p>
      <p>The car ride didn’t help her stomach. When the mustang squealed around the corner
         where
         Saint Ambrose stood, Cassie caught her breath. They were headed to his apartment.
         The
         one he threw her out of.</p>
      <p>“You know where he lives?” she blurted out.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I do.” Caleb screeched to a stop in front of James’ house. He cut the
         engine
         and swung the door open. “The question is, how do you know where we are?”</p>
      <p>He got out of the car, leaving her open-mouthed and speechless.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>By the time she reached the back entrance, rain soaked through her clothing. Caleb
         pounded the door with both fists, rattling the square of glass.</p>
      <p>She pressed her back against the siding, under the eaves. “I can explain.”</p>
      <p>“For fuck sakes, Cassie.” Caleb stopped pounding. “Just help me get in the house.
         Check
         the windows.”</p>
      <p>“Are you sure he’s here?” James’ car sat in the driveway, but the entire house was
         in
         darkness. He could be anywhere. “Maybe Alexa picked him up.” Or Emily.</p>
      <p>Caleb rested his forehead against the door. “According to his phone, he’s here.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Tall grasses grew along the side of the house. She pushed them aside and rapped on
         the
         window. When she got no answer, she tried to slide the glass. The window refused to
         budge. Same with the next one. She wiped mud away with the bottom of James’ T-shirt,
         but
         inside was darker than outside and offered no clues.</p>
      <p>A loud crack shook the house. She scrambled to her feet and raced to the back stoop.
         The
         door hung lopsided on its remaining hinge, the basement an ominous black hole. Hair
         rose
         on her arms. Kicking James’ door in was rash, even for Caleb. She descended into the
         darkness, the stairs two at a time.</p>
      <p>Caleb stood in the middle of James’ apartment, silhouetted by evening sky. “Where’s
         the
         damn light switch?”</p>
      <p>Glass crunched under her shoes, as she passed James’ bed to hit the switch. Proof
         she’d
         been inside. She didn’t have time to dwell on it.</p>
      <p>James lay slumped against the wall, next to the bathroom door. Still shirtless, his
         chest and lips were wet with foam, his jeans, undone. Under him the carpet was a mess
         of
         blood and vomit. The towel he used as a Band-Aid lay a few feet away, covered in red.
         He
         still held his phone.</p>
      <p>“Cassie! Call 911.” Caleb dropped to his knees and pressed two fingers against James’
         wrist. “I’m not getting a pulse.”</p>
      <p>She crumpled to the floor as Caleb laid James flat and tipped his head. Using his
         baby
         finger, he scooped foam from James’ mouth, then grabbed his shoulders and shook. “Wake
         up.”</p>
      <p>James’ head rolled back, lifeless and limp.</p>
      <p>“CASSIE,” Caleb shouted, “911.”</p>
      <p>Cassie clawed her phone from her pocket. The device slipped from her grasp. She
         scrambled for it then punched in the numbers.</p>
      <p>“911.” The emergency dispatch answered. “What is your emergency?”</p>
      <p>“Our friend is unconscious,” Cassie blurted out.</p>
      <p>“Calm down.” The operator’s voice was firm. “Does he have a pulse?”</p>
      <p>“Pulse,” she yelled at Caleb, “can you find his pulse?”</p>
      <p>Tears streamed down Caleb’s cheeks. “I don't know. Fuck.” He clasped his fingers in
         front of him as if in prayer.</p>
      <p>“Check again. The carotid one,” she echoed the dispatcher’s words, “it’s in his
         neck.”</p>
      <p>“I know where it is.” Caleb brought his fingers to James’ neck. He repositioned them.
         An
         eternity passed with each second, then a tiny smile tweaked Caleb’s lip. “He has a
         pulse. Its weak. But it's there.” He shook James again, softer this time. “James.
         Breathe for me, man.”</p>
      <p>James gurgled. Both a horrible and wonderful sound. Caleb slumped back.</p>
      <p>“He has a pulse,” Cassie repeated to the operator. “He’s making noise, like he’s
         drowning. Caleb, put him on his…”</p>
      <p>Caleb looked at her, expectant.</p>
      <p>“What?” she said into the phone. “Lay him on his left side. Here. You talk.” She crawled
         to Caleb and handed over her phone.</p>
      <p>Edging backward, she ended up on James’ bed. Too terrified for tears, she hugged his
         pillow. A prescription bottle rolled against her thigh. It was empty.</p>
      <p>“Caleb.” She tossed him the container.</p>
      <p>“Jesus. Xanax. Who in the hell prescribed these?” Caleb recited the label to the 911
         operator then huddled next to James. “I feel so fucking helpless.”</p>
      <p>She buried her head into the pillow. It took a second to process the screaming sound
         of
         sirens came from right outside the house.</p>
      <p>“Go lead them in here,” Caleb said, “I’m not leaving him.”</p>
      <p>The paramedic’s followed her down the stairs. From James’ mattress, she peeked through
         her fingers as Caleb stepped away, allowing them to strap James’ to a gurney.</p>
      <p>This is why people think you have a death wish, she wanted to scream, but all the
         energy
         had drained out of her.</p>
      <p>If he died, she would be the last one to see him alive. God. If he died.</p>
      <p>The paramedics balked at Caleb’s attempts to ride along, and there was no friendly
         cop
         to suggest it might be a good idea. In the end, James made the trip alone, leaving
         the
         spot where he lay a quagmire of bodily fluids and muddy boot prints. Voices echoed
         up
         the stairway until there was nothing but silence, the small apartment cavernous in
         their
         absence.</p>
      <p>Caleb stumbled into the bathroom and shut the door. The sound of him retching twisted
         her stomach. At least if she puked, not much would come up. She laid back on the bed,
         the room spinning around her.</p>
      <p>The bathroom door opened. Caleb leaned against the door frame, one hand behind his
         back.
         He aged ten years in the last twenty minutes.</p>
      <p>Wanting comfort, she sat up and waited for Caleb to do his thing; tell her James would
         be alright—that she would be alright. But his eyes were hollow. He brought his hand
         into
         view. Hanging limply from his fingers were her bra and shirt. The ones she wore to
         bed
         last night. His bed. Last night at the pool house when she made out with him.</p>
      <p>She gasped, a reflexive action to something that should be bad, but she didn’t care
         anymore. James could be dead. Her James.</p>
      <p>“I wondered why you were wearing one of his band shirts,” Caleb said. “I thought it
         might be one he left at the pool house. I assumed you were too smart to be that obvious.
         Is he the reason you jumped out of my bed so early this morning?”</p>
      <p>She nodded, the truth liberating.</p>
      <p>“Did you tell him you spent the night with me?”</p>
      <p>“We didn't really discuss it.”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s eyes widened, his mouth twisted. “He better be okay, Cassie.” He tossed her
         stuff at her, they landed at her feet.</p>
      <p>“Get out,” he said when she failed to move. “I'm going to the hospital, and I'm not
         leaving you in his apartment.”</p>
      <p>“T-Take me with you.” She needed to see him. “He’ll want me there.”</p>
      <p>His face reddened. “Stay the fuck away from him. For the love of God, I warned you.
         He
         can't deal with this.”</p>
      <p>Caleb had been right, of course. James couldn’t handle her. She wanted him to pick
         her
         over everything else, then when he tried to, she was too scared to let go of the tiny
         bit of security she had with Caleb, to give James a chance. She made him miserable.
         She
         made him cry.</p>
      <p>“Now.” Caleb stood by the door, an irrefutable hint to leave, to vanish from their
         lives.</p>
      <p>“What about us?” He was the first guy she slept with and had been her friend if nothing
         else.</p>
      <p>“Us?” He gave her a weird chuckle. “There is no us. Get out.”</p>
      <p>The words resounded in her heart. There had been no them since they picked up James
         from
         Tracy’s that first night, only now it was official.</p>
      <p>Chin up, she waltzed past Caleb and climbed the steps, out of their lives. Outside,
         the
         air turned crisp. The first taste of fall. She headed north instead of going home.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s car sped past. He screeched to a stop at the corner, then peeled around the
         curb, the old church obscuring her view.</p>
      <p>Pulling out her phone, she scrolled for Emily's number.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Emily.” She texted. “Come pick me up?”</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
