         <h4>Chapter 3</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Caleb inched backward on the chaise and pulled out his phone. There were other chairs
         under the pergola, but Cassie perched on the end of his, one heel propped on the floral
         cushion, so she could paint her toenails.</p>
      <p>He’d taken her to three movies, a bunch of restaurants and on a boat tour of the city.
         Somehow, he managed to evade James for the entire week, not an easy task at first.
         But
         by midweek James stopped trying to contact him. Now he couldn’t find the guy.</p>
      <p>He’d wanted space. He hadn’t wanted James to vanish.</p>
      <p>Angling his phone away from Cassie, he sent message number six into the James’ void.
         I
         need a response from you. Please.</p>
      <p>He sighed. At least his liver was getting a holiday—even though his conscience
         wasn’t.</p>
      <p>“Am I boring you?” Cassie stared toward her half-painted toes.</p>
      <p>She wasn’t. Compared to his time with James, hanging with Cassie relaxed him. Not
         wanting her to confuse boring with soothing, he shoved his phone into his pocket and
         leaned toward her. “You have a calming effect on me.”</p>
      <p>“Calm. That’s nice—I guess.” She finished her other foot in record time and wiggled
         her
         toes. “What do you think?”</p>
      <p>He studied her handiwork for a few seconds. The purple paint matched the fallen wisteria
         blooms. “I like the color. The jewel undertone compliments your skin tone.”</p>
      <p>Her focus shifted from the polish to him. “What do you know about skin tones? Sometimes
         I wonder about you, Caleb. You’re very private.” She pointed the paint applicator
         at
         him. “Let me guess. You have a foot fetish and are an expert at polishing women’s
         toes.
         Or maybe you polish your own?”</p>
      <p>“For the record, feet are gross.” </p>
      <p>“My feet aren’t gross.” She capped the polish. “But that’s an interesting fact about
         you. Tell me something else.”</p>
      <p>There was a restlessness about her he couldn’t put his finger on. It made him uneasy.
         “There’s nothing interesting about me.”</p>
      <p>“What about all those instruments in the pool house,” she said after a few seconds,
         “I
         counted seven. That’s unusual. Can you play them all?”</p>
      <p>There were eight if you counted James’ harmonica, stashed in the bedside table. And
         yes,
         he could play them all, but didn’t wish to spend the next hour proving he could, if
         that’s where this was headed. He smiled even though he wasn’t enjoying the third degree
         and was no longer relaxed. “I can play more than the guitar, and technically, they
         aren’t all mine.”</p>
      <p>Cassie humphed. “Oh yeah, I forgot about your imaginary friend, James.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t the first time she dropped James’ name, and every time he brushed her off.
         “What do you want to do today?”</p>
      <p>Her jaw tightened, then relaxed. “Can we do something exciting?”</p>
      <p>“Exciting?” That was sort of insulting and—since he’d been enjoying their quiet
         evenings—not what he expected. “Like what?”</p>
      <p>She shifted onto her own chair and stared across the space at him. “Because you’re
         so
         secretive, I’m not going to tell you. Let’s see how well you know me. Guess.”</p>
      <p>With no idea, he shook his head. “I don’t understand girls at all.”</p>
      <p>“You’ve had like a zillion girlfriends. You must have women figured out by now.”</p>
      <p>Pure embellishment, but he grinned. “I thought I understood them, then I met you.”</p>
      <p>It was the truth. She didn’t drink or smoke, so he was careful not to talk about getting
         drunk or high. She seemed almost prudish, but he got the impression she found his
         attempts at getting to know her frustrating and would be more than willing to fall
         into
         his bed. The very thing he wanted to avoid.</p>
      <p>“You’re a mystery to me,” he said in earnest. Her cheeks turned an amazing shade of
         pink, a surprising turn on. He swung his leg over the chaise so he could lean closer,
         his fingertips edging the cuff of her shorts. “You’re not wowed by my good looks or
         amazing charm. It throws me off my game.”</p>
      <p>“I am wowed.” She patted his knee. “I just don't want to feed your ego.”</p>
      <p>The words to a great comeback all but materialized when the gate slammed shut. That
         had
         to be James, finally. But Ronnie emerged from behind the garage.</p>
      <p>Caleb sighed. Next time he saw James, he planned on strangling him.</p>
      <p>Ronnie left his flip flops by the pool and proceeded across the grass to sit on the
         end
         of Caleb’s newly empty chaise.</p>
      <p>“Ronnie, this is Cassie,” Caleb ran a quick introduction, “our new neighbor.”</p>
      <p>Ron issued an absentminded nod. “What the fuck did you do to James?”</p>
      <p>“You’ve seen him?” The news almost made Ron’s appearance worthwhile.</p>
      <p>“Sure did,” Ron said, “Last night. He’s pissed at you, man.”</p>
      <p>Caleb groaned. “I didn’t do anything to him.” Ignoring was the opposite of doing,
         wasn’t
         it? He gave Ron a poisonous glare intent on shutting him up.</p>
      <p>As usual, Ron missed the fine print. “That’s not what James said.”</p>
      <p>With no idea where this was headed, Caleb stood up. “Cassie, don’t you want to head
         out?” The sordid details of one of James’ escapades would likely scare the pants off
         her; and she didn’t need to discover he’d been ignoring his friend. He would text
         Ron
         for the details later.</p>
      <p>She shook her head. “I want to hear Ron’s story.”</p>
      <p>Ignoring Ron’s smug smile, Caleb flopped onto the cushion ready to do damage
         control.</p>
      <p>“I bumped into James last night, playing cards in Tyrone Yate’s basement. I asked
         him
         where you were and he said you were a, dirtbird, probably off chasin’ a new set of
         diddies.” Ronnie paused.</p>
      <p>It was a hilarious imitation of James, but Caleb refused to bite.</p>
      <p>“Go on,” Cassie inspected her nails then reopened the polish.</p>
      <p>Ron’s grin widened. “He accused two guys of cheating. Flipped a table over and
         everything.”</p>
      <p>“What happened to him?” Refusing to give Ron any satisfaction, Caleb kept his voice
         steady.</p>
      <p>“Nothing happened to him. He had to be pulled off the one dude.”</p>
      <p>Despite trying not to, Caleb grinned. James won more battles than he lost.</p>
      <p>Ron’s smile faded. “What are you grinning like a jackass for? Didn’t you hear me?
         He’s
         pissed at you. I wouldn't want him pissed at me.”</p>
      <p>“That’s why you came over? To warn me?” Caleb laughed. “I already knew James was mad
         at
         me. He'll get over it.”</p>
      <p>“So, you did do something to him?” Ron’s frown twisted into a smirk, one that said
         ‘ah-ha, got you’.</p>
      <p>Caleb glanced at Cassie. Her bright-eyed interest bugged him as much as Ron’s
         attitude.</p>
      <p>She blew on her newly painted fingers. “When am I going to meet this guy?”</p>
      <p>“She hasn’t met James?” Ronnie’s gaze flicked to Cassie, then back to Caleb. He shook
         his head. “Never mind. What's going on today?”</p>
      <p>Lost, Caleb looked to Cassie for direction.</p>
      <p>“Shopping. Caleb’s taking me to the Woodfield Mall.” She beamed.</p>
      <p>A trip to the mall wouldn’t be a problem, except Woodfield housed his headless, Yolo
         photo. He busted his ass last summer working in their store to secure that print,
         while
         James lasted less than two weeks as a greeter, folding shirts—yet got invited to the
         same shoot.</p>
      <p>He gave Cassie the thumbs up. “What are you shopping for?” Since his face wasn't in
         the
         photo, she’d never recognize him, but with any luck she’d hate that brand.</p>
      <p>“Stuff to go out in. Someplace different.”</p>
      <p>“Different?” Where could she possibly want to go, that he hadn’t taken her? He lifted
         his hands. “I’m out of entertainment ideas.”</p>
      <p>“My friend from summer school keeps talking about parties. Do you know anything about
         that stuff?”</p>
      <p>Ron stifled a laugh.</p>
      <p>“I do,” Caleb replied warily, her request eerily similar to the slew of girls he’d
         hung
         with who wanted him for the clubs he could get them into. “But I’ve been enjoying
         your
         company solo. Maybe I'm not ready to share you yet.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe I'm ready to be shared.”</p>
      <p>“Ouch.” Ronnie chuckled as he stared across the yard.</p>
      <p>Caleb opened his mouth and shut it. A lot of girls would have loved to have his
         undivided attention for one day, let alone seven. Yet here she was, needing more,
         while
         he did cartwheels trying to please her. Dating exhausted him.</p>
      <p>Ron cleared his throat. “Who are you hanging with at summer school?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah. Who is telling you about parties?” He hadn’t given her an official you’re my
         girlfriend talk, and they hadn’t moved past kissing, but he’d put in enough effort
         to
         consider them together.</p>
      <p>“My friend Allison.”</p>
      <p>“What’s her last name?” He dated an Allison freshman year.</p>
      <p>“Ziegler.”</p>
      <p>“Allison Ziegler?” Ron’s wide eyes betrayed Caleb.</p>
      <p>Cassie tapped a finger to her forehead. “Let me guess. Considering Ron’s response,
         I
         assume she’s an ex.”</p>
      <p>“Yes.” Lying would be pointless with Ron there. “But I haven't talked to her since
         ninth
         grade.” It was close enough to the truth. “Did you mention me?”</p>
      <p>“Not by your full name. But I will now. Unless you don’t want me to.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t care.” What else could he say?</p>
      <p>His mom appeared in the back doorway, one of her frilly aprons around her waist. “I
         made
         sandwiches. Enough for you too, Ron.”</p>
      <p>“No thanks, Mrs. P.” Ronnie stepped into his flip-flops. “As entertaining as this
         is,
         I’ve got to bolt. Have fun at the mall, Callie.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t fucking call me that, Ronald.” Caleb flipped Ron the finger, but he’d already
         rounded the garage.</p>
      <p>“Caleb. Be nice.” His mom planted her hands on her hips. “James calls you Callie all
         the
         time.”</p>
      <p>And since James made the nickname up, he, and only he, could use it. He waved at his
         mother. “We’ll be right in.”</p>
      <p>“Your mom is so nice.” Cassie wandered to the pool. She sat cross-legged on the edge
         and
         stirred the water with her fingers. “You don’t have to take me shopping. You’ve been
         preoccupied most of today. If you want me to go home, I can.”</p>
      <p>Preoccupied. Great. Why was it so difficult to have something for himself? All he
         asked
         for was time alone to get to know a girl. A girl that actually liked him, not one
         who
         followed him around like a puppy.</p>
      <p>He joined Cassie. Now that he knew James was breathing, one more evening of freedom
         couldn’t hurt.</p>
      <p>“Look.” He set his phone to, do not disturb. “I’m all yours.” </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
