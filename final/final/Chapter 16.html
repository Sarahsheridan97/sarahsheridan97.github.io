         <h4>Chapter 16</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Two male attendants wheeled a gurney carrying a sleeping James into the room. They
         stopped alongside the bed, undid the limb restraints that kept James tethered, and
         shifted him blankets and all, onto the mattress. After raising the bed rails, they
         secured him in the same manner.</p>
      <p>One of them yanked on the straps, then left with the gurney. The other fastened a
         clear
         bag with a tube, to the other side of the bed.</p>
      <p>James looked pathetic. Cassie made eye contact with the remaining attendant. “Does
         he
         need to be strapped to the bed?”</p>
      <p>“An incident in the recovery room required restraints.”</p>
      <p>James had been awake and causing problems. Good news—and typical. “So, he'll be okay?”
         she asked.</p>
      <p>“It’s unlikely they’d release him to a room if there was a concern.” The attendant
         adjusted the incline of James' bed and stepped back. “The doctor gave him something
         to
         calm him down and he should sleep till morning—but here’s the call button if you need
         help. I think it’s safe to say, your friend is not happy to be here.”</p>
      <p>Cassie huffed, “I wouldn’t be happy, either, if I woke up confused and in pain.” She
         flicked the rubber straps fastening him to the bed. “When can these come off?”</p>
      <p>“That’s for the doctors to figure out.” Finished with his job, the attendant headed
         for
         the door. “A doctor arrives around six to do rounds. In the meantime, the floor nurse
         will be in to check on him.” He turned off the light. “You should get some sleep while
         he's out.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The room held a different vibe with James in it. Cassie yawned and stretched. The
         empty
         bed invited her. She should have asked for permission to use it.</p>
      <p>She dragged the recliner closer to James’ bed, and plunked down. Her phone read three
         forty-five. Another attempt at calling Caleb proved futile. Not surprisingly. He would
         have called her by now if he could.</p>
      <p>James’ chest rose and fell in a steady rhythm. He seemed peaceful enough. The missing
         utensil made an enormous difference.</p>
      <p>Curiosity got the best of her and she lowered the bed rail. Antiseptic assaulted her
         nose as she lifted the blanket. James had been dressed in a short cotton gown. She
         inched it back. Clean bandages replaced the blood and gore—and covered the entire
         area.
         A single tube stuck out from under the top of the gauze. It disappeared over the other
         side of the bed.</p>
      <p>She tucked the blanket back in.</p>
      <p>He stirred. “Mam. Tábrón orm!”</p>
      <p>Her breath caught. The frantic pitch to his voice made the back of her neck sweaty.
         She
         didn’t need Caleb to tell her 'mam' meant 'mom'—or remind her that James’ mother was
         dead. She glanced around half expecting to see a spirit emerging from the room’s dark
         corners.</p>
      <p>James turned toward her, but his eyes were shut. “Callie, watch out!”</p>
      <p>Snapping the rail back in place, she waited, expecting trouble. But his eyes remained
         closed. He continued to mutter but didn’t test his confines. After a couple of minutes,
         she headed to the bathroom. The bright fluorescent fixture spilled light into the
         other
         room—and would stay on.</p>
      <p>She pulled a blanket off the other bed and hunkered in the recliner. Eventually James’
         babbling, a scrambled mixture of English and Irish, faded as she fell asleep.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A sense of vertigo roused her. Half asleep, she sprang to her feet and stood
         blinking.</p>
      <p>James' bed rocked against her chair. His eyes were open. With clenched fists, he jerked
         his shoulders upward.</p>
      <p>The bed shook and he winced in pain, but it didn’t stop him from trying again.</p>
      <p>“Stop.” She grabbed his hand.</p>
      <p>He gasped as if he didn’t realize someone was there. His head jerked to her, his eyes
         wide—and vacant.</p>
      <p>For the first time, Cassie welcomed the restraints.</p>
      <p>“Hey.” She leaned over him.</p>
      <p>“Cal?” He sounded hopeful even though he stared right at her.</p>
      <p>Cassie shook her head. “It’s me, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>“Angel?” he managed. “Let me out.”</p>
      <p>He recognized her. Thank God. She leaned against the rail. “Do you want me to get
         the
         nurse?”</p>
      <p>He shook his head and jerked his arm. “Please.”</p>
      <p>“I tried to get them to take these off, but you need a doctor to okay it.” She massaged
         the area around the foam cuff. True to what the paramedics noted, his skin wasn't
         smooth, but the semi-darkness and tattoos concealed all his secrets.</p>
      <p>James pulled away, as far as his restricted mobility allowed. His gutted moan broke
         her
         heart. The restraints would be easy enough to undo, but she’d probably get thrown
         out.
         Helpless, she gripped the side bar. James’ cheeks were sleek with sweat, and maybe
         tears.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be right back.” She stepped away. “I promise.”</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the bathroom was equipped with a facecloth. She ran it under water and
         returned to lower James’ bedrail. His eyes tracked the cloth as she held it up. “It’s
         cold,” she said, “It will make you feel better.”</p>
      <p>After wiping his face, she folded the cloth and laid it across his forehead. “It’s
         okay,” she touched his cheek. “I'm here. Close your eyes and go back to sleep.”</p>
      <p>He leaned into her palm; his skin hot. A minute passed before he closed his eyes.</p>
      <p>She waited until his breathing steadied, then straightened her clothes. It was
         five-fifty. Time for coffee and to check if the doctor had arrived.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The nursing station buzzed with activity. “You’re awake.” A male nurse in pale lavender
         scrubs stepped out of the station. “You slept through my floor checks.”</p>
      <p>“You came into the room?”</p>
      <p>“Twice.” He smiled. “I heard you were concerned about the restraints, so I listed
         James’
         name at the top of the rounds.”</p>
      <p>“Thanks,” Cassie said.</p>
      <p>“Are you planning to stay another night, hun?”</p>
      <p>She hadn’t thought that far ahead, but it hurt her to picture James waking up alone.
         “If
         I can,” she said.</p>
      <p>“You’ll need to get a visitor’s badge from reception downstairs.”</p>
      <p>Relief flooded her. “I'll do that now.”</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>She’d drunk half her coffee by the time the doctor made his appearance. Dressed
         stylishly under his lab coat, a lime green shirt and dark trousers, the doctor was
         younger than expected.</p>
      <p>He extended his hand. “I’m Dr. Lowell.” He walked around the bed and lifted the blanket.
         “I heard you spent the night. Did he wake up at all?”</p>
      <p>“For about ten minutes,” Cassie replied.</p>
      <p>“Was he aware of his surroundings?”</p>
      <p>“He was scared. He wanted those off.” She pointed to the restraints. “But I don't
         think
         he knew where he was.” She pulled the appointment card that listed James last name
         as
         O’Sullivan from her pocket. “Here, before I forget. It has his other name on it.”</p>
      <p>“Other name?” His brows merged as he read the card. “Dr. Madison is a psychiatrist
         on
         staff here. We should have had this information right away.”</p>
      <p>“I found it this morning.” She met his eyes. “Sorry.”</p>
      <p>The furrows in his forehead deepened. “I’m going to borrow this and make a call. I’ll
         be
         right back.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie propped her butt against the heating unit that ran under the windows, her back
         against the curtains and sipped her coffee. James seemed too still. As much as she’d
         wanted him to sleep last night, she wanted him to wake up now.</p>
      <p>Not much time passed before Dr. Lowell returned. He strode to the bed and removed
         the
         restraints. Reflectively, James drew his arms toward his core. His eyelids flickered,
         then blinked open.</p>
      <p>“Do you mind waiting outside?” Doctor Lowell asked her. “I need a moment.”</p>
      <p>Despite not wanting to, she headed to the hall.</p>
      <p>“Everything looks good,” Dr Lowell said, when he joined her. He motioned for her to
         follow. “Your friend is awake and asking for someone named Caleb. I told him you were
         here. He seemed surprised.”</p>
      <p>Great, he didn’t remember waking up last night—or how much she helped him. They stopped
         in front of the nursing station. “I'm standing in for Caleb,” she said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Lowell nodded. “James gave me permission to talk to you. The wound closed nicely,
         unless he does something crazy to aggravate it, should heal well.”</p>
      <p>Cassie snorted. It would never heal, everything James did was crazy.</p>
      <p>“He's on an antibiotic,” the doctor continued, “due to his history, his medications
         have
         been changed.”</p>
      <p>“His history?”</p>
      <p>Creases reappeared in Dr. Lowell’s forehead. “In case you were unaware, Dr. Madison
         is
         James’ psychiatrist. He’ll be taking over and will visit later today.”</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>James was fully awake by the time she got back to the room and arguing with a
         white-haired nurse.</p>
      <p>The nurse heaved an exasperated sigh. “No, you can't have more pain medication. Your
         new
         order is very specific about what you can and cannot have.”</p>
      <p>“Come on, luv…” His gaze caught Cassie in the doorway. He covered his eyes with his
         forearm.</p>
      <p>The nurse turned around. “You must be the girlfriend?”</p>
      <p>Cassie glanced at James, but his arm masked his full expression.</p>
      <p>“How do you deal with him?” The woman held up a box of Kleenex. “He threw this at
         me.”</p>
      <p>“You would be cranky too if someone stuck a knife in you,” Cassie said.</p>
      <p>The corner of James’ mouth lifted.</p>
      <p>The nurse tapped the mattress. “On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the highest,
         where would you rate your pain level?”</p>
      <p>“I had a knife stuck in me. What do you feckin think?”</p>
      <p>“From your attitude, I'll assume you are somewhere around a six to a seven. If your
         pain
         becomes unmanageable, tell us, and we will see what we can do. She looked at Cassie.
         “Don't let him lie there and suffer.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll try not to.” Like James would be honest with her about how much pain he was
         in.
         Fat chance.</p>
      <p>The nurse nodded. “Breakfast is on its way. Get something solid into him. Most
         importantly, make sure he stays hydrated.” She pointed to the table where two Styrofoam
         cups had appeared, complete with bendy straws. “I want him to drink both glasses by
         noon.”</p>
      <p>Cassie stifled a laugh. The nurse’s assumption she had any control over James’ behavior
         was hilarious.</p>
      <p>“When we are sure he can hydrate himself, we’ll remove the catheter and the IV. It’s
         important to get him functioning and up and moving.”</p>
      <p>“Jaysus,” James mumbled, both arms now over his face.</p>
      <p>“Sure,” Cassie tried not to smile. It was amusing to watch him squirm for once. “I'll
         get him to have a few bites.”</p>
      <p>“Oh,” the nurse tugged one of James’ arms, “You are moving to a private room this
         afternoon. Doctor’s orders.”</p>
      <p>James buried his eyes in the crook of his remaining elbow. “Good. A fucking upgrade.
         The
         view from this window sucks.”</p>
      <p>“Behave Mr. Whatever-your-name-is. I’m going to sit you up for breakfast. Tell me
         if it
         hurts.” The nurse hit a switch and the head of the bed slowly adjusted into a incline.
         “I'll be back later to make sure you're doing what you should.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Cassie, go home,” James said as soon as they were alone. “I don't want you here and
         don’t need your help.”</p>
      <p>The words hurt, but whether he cared to admit it or not, he needed her.</p>
      <p>“Caleb wants me to stay,” she said, “they took him to the police station. He hasn’t
         contacted me yet,” she added before he could ask.</p>
      <p>“Shit.” James lowered his arm and tried to sit, but only made it to his elbows. “He’s
         never been in jail. I’ve got to help him.”</p>
      <p>“You can’t leave.” The thought was laughable. “Your too weak. I’d have to carry you.</p>
      <p>Frustration tied up his features when he realized she was right. He slumped against
         the
         pillows and glared at her.</p>
      <p>A plump woman rattled a breakfast cart through the door, saving Cassie from further
         wrath. The smell of food filled the room.</p>
      <p>“James Fitzpatrick?” she said.</p>
      <p>“Aye.” James appeared unimpressed.</p>
      <p>The woman located a green tray and checked the tag before bringing it forward. “One
         post-surgery meal, full of fiber.” She set it on the table and clacked the cart out
         the
         door.</p>
      <p>“Yum.” Cassie inspected the tray. A bowl of oatmeal, peaches on the side, watery
         soft-boiled eggs, and two slices of whole wheat toast. Her stomach growled.</p>
      <p>“Feel free to eat my fiber,” James offered. “I wish people would stop obsessing about
         my
         bodily functions. At least in front of you.”</p>
      <p>She chuckled. “Come on, James. You heard that nurse. Have a bit of toast and drink
         some
         water. You must be thirsty.”</p>
      <p>“She can suck me. I’m not thirsty. I feel like puking.”</p>
      <p>Cassie dropped half of the fruit into the oatmeal. She peeked at him over the tray.
         He
         studied his hands, which shook like crazy. With a grim expression, he balled his fingers
         into a fist.</p>
      <p>Pretending she didn’t notice, she opened a sugar package, poured it into the coffee
         and
         stirred. “I know you want all those tubes out.”</p>
      <p>“No effing shit. And I'm extra thrilled that you know exactly where all those tubes
         are.” He peered under the blanket. “Bloody hell. Where’s my…” He slid his hand
         underneath.</p>
      <p>Cassie stopped stirring. “What are you doing?” </p>
      <p>“Checking to see if I can pull this out.”</p>
      <p>“What out? Never mind, don't answer that. You're going to damage…something.” She gripped
         his hand from on top of the blanket.</p>
      <p>He snickered. “That's not my hand you're grabbing.”</p>
      <p>Damn him. She jerked away. “Stop. Okay? You’re going to hurt yourself.”</p>
      <p>“Just yanking your chain, angel. That was my hand.” He threw her a small grin. “And
         I
         already hurt. I could sleep for a week. There is no way that cranky old nurse is taking
         anything out of me. I'd rather you do it.”</p>
      <p>“Have some water.” Cassie grabbed one of waters and tipped the straw in his direction.
         The way his hands shook, he would die of thirst before he reached for the cup in front
         of her.</p>
      <p>He licked his lips. After a few seconds, he opened his mouth and she brought the straw
         to his lips.</p>
      <p>He sucked down more than half the cup. “Toast, please.”</p>
      <p>She fed him the rest of the fruit and a piece of toast. “Okay, James, enough of this
         helplessness. You are capable of feeding yourself. Caleb says when you get like this,
         it
         is easier to go along with it. But I disagree.”</p>
      <p>“Cal needs something better to do with his mouth than talk about me. I can offer a
         suggestion if you like?”</p>
      <p>She shook her head. “By the way, Doctor Madison is coming to see you this
         afternoon.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah. I figured he’d show.” James pushed the recline button himself. “I'm knackered.
         I’m going to close my eyes, and when I open them, I want you to not be here.”</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
