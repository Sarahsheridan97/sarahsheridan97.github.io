         <h4>Chapter 27</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Cassie blinked at the plain gray wall that met the edge of the white-sheeted mattress,
         her skin prickly with sweat. Steady breaths against her back warned her, wherever
         she
         was, she wasn’t alone.</p>
      <p>She drifted her hand along her body. Underwear on. Shirt on. Careful not to jiggle
         the
         bed, she rolled over. James lay on his stomach, face tipped to her, features relaxed
         in
         sleep. A sheet covered his bottom half, but his back was bare.</p>
      <p>Sucking in air, she squeezed her eyelids tight. She was by the lake—with James. At
         some
         point, she was sure he kissed her.</p>
      <p>“Shit.” She scanned the length of his body. What was she doing in a bed with him?</p>
      <p>His long lashes fluttered, then parted. His eyes widened, and a slow smile tugged
         at the
         corner of his mouth.</p>
      <p>“Good morning, luv.” He rose onto his elbows, his back curved. “How’s your head. You’re
         not going to puke on me, are you?”</p>
      <p>She navigated into a sitting position and rubbed her eyes. “Tell me I didn't throw
         up on
         you. And please tell me you're wearing something on your bottom half.”</p>
      <p>“My bottom half is wearing boxer briefs.” He flipped onto his back and his grin grew
         wider. “Good thing too, or you might’ve had your way with me last night.”</p>
      <p>The already hot room became claustrophobic. She clutched her stomach, needing water,
         oxygen—space. The only two windows sat high on the far wall. A thick book held the
         nearest one open but the air remained stagnant.</p>
      <p>“What’s the matter?” James sounded wary. “I’m slagging you, Cassie. You still have
         your
         panties on, right?”</p>
      <p>She nodded. Using her hand, she tried to create air. “It’s awfully stuffy in here.”</p>
      <p>He leaned forward exposing the ass of his white Calvin Klein underwear, and clicked
         the
         fan perched on a high wooden stool, between his footboard and dresser. Much needed
         air
         cooled her damp skin.</p>
      <p>“That should help—and this.” He handed her a glass of water and a pill from the bedside
         table. “It can feel like you’re suffocating in here. Some nights, when it’s a scorcher,
         I walk to the pool house just so I can sleep.”</p>
      <p>The water was warm, but wet. The fan passed over her again and unstuck the hair from
         her
         neck. She handed the glass back to James. His hair curled into adorable ringlets.</p>
      <p>He grinned. “Stop looking at me like I have two heads.”</p>
      <p>“I never noticed you had such cute curls before.” It was a lie. She noticed every
         time
         they swam. His sun-dried locks would kick up in soft loops along his neck, the dark
         wisps taking on amber highlights like little licks of flame.</p>
      <p>He pulled at the strands then patted them in place. “Some days I need a damn flat
         iron
         to tame this mop.”</p>
      <p>Flat iron? The only iron guys in Kansas talked about, was a branding iron. She peeked
         at
         him, and his honest smile pulled something inside her. “Where are we, anyway?”</p>
      <p>“You're in my apartment. C'ead mi'le fa'ilte.” He motioned about. “Welcome to all
         of
         this.”</p>
      <p>She surveyed the long rectangular room, searching for an insider's glimpse of James,
         the
         one that knew about flat irons. The one that told her you can’t force love.</p>
      <p>A black leather sofa heaped with blankets occupied the far corner. An electric guitar
         laid across a coffee table, and a huge metal crucifix hung between a flat-screen TV
         and
         a closed door.</p>
      <p>He trusted her enough to allow her to invade his privacy. “Does Caleb even know where
         you live?”</p>
      <p>“No one knows. It's how I like it,” he hedged, “and Cal knows better than to press
         me
         for details.”</p>
      <p>“Why’d you bring me here, then?”</p>
      <p>“You were covered in puke. I couldn’t abandon you in your doorway, and you were mad
         at
         Cal for standing you up. That crossed off the pool house.”</p>
      <p>Her shoulders slumped with the memory. She’d been such a bitch to Caleb all week,
         she
         could hardly blame him for avoiding her. “After he told me he couldn't make it, he
         stopped replying to my texts. . . I hope he’s okay.”</p>
      <p>“I'm sure he's fine,” James sounded less than thrilled. “I’ll call him if you want.”</p>
      <p>“No.” The word burst out of her. What would he say? ‘Cassie got too drunk to go home?’
         She would die of humiliation. “It’s okay. I’m meeting him later. I'll get the details
         then.”</p>
      <p>She took a deep breath. “So… this is your family home?”</p>
      <p>“No family. Remember. This is my apartment—in my old foster family’s basement.”</p>
      <p>“Are you close to your foster parents?”</p>
      <p>“Not really. I was almost fourteen when I moved here. I stayed away from them for
         the
         most part, but they let me stay when I phased out. They didn’t have to.”</p>
      <p>“Phased out?”</p>
      <p>“Transitioned into independent living.” He rolled his eyes. “None of it matters. I
         emancipated myself from my real mom as soon as the law permitted, at sixteen. I'm
         completely on my own.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t mean to pry.” She always said the wrong thing around him.</p>
      <p>“That's okay, angel.” He fiddled with the sheet. “Does Cal ever say anything about
         me?
         Stuff about my life?”</p>
      <p>“Not really.” Careful with her words, she needled through her reply. “He hates it
         when
         he doesn’t know where you are. You should tell him you have a home. It would make
         him
         feel better.”</p>
      <p>“He knows I have a home. He’s just not sure where it is. Promise you'll keep this
         a
         secret.”</p>
      <p>She nodded. “So, this is your sanctuary? Where you hide from the world?”</p>
      <p>“Something like that.” His mouth tightened, but the tiny quirk of his eyebrow registered
         surprise.</p>
      <p>“I get it,” she said. After all, she spent almost a year hiding in her bedroom. “We
         all
         need to disappear sometimes. You're not planning to make me leave with a pillowcase
         on
         my head, are you?”</p>
      <p>His pinched expression softened. “No pillowcases or blindfolds. Unless you like that
         type of stuff.” He scooted backward, his back against the headboard. The sheet slipped
         down to his thighs. “I guess this makes us cohorts.”</p>
      <p>Pillowcases… cohorts... something… She nodded to be agreeable, but her eyes drifted
         to
         the lump under the yoked front of his snug, white boxer briefs and the way his stomach
         flattened between his hip bones. His stomach tattoo teased her. She only got to see
         half
         of that darn thing.</p>
      <p>He tugged the sheet up. “Relax. You are only a few blocks from your house. You'll
         see
         when you leave.”</p>
      <p>“You live close.” The fan jet streamed another blast of much-needed coolness over
         her
         flushed skin. “That explains your random appearances.”</p>
      <p>“That's me.” He shut his eyes. “All about being arbitrary.”</p>
      <p>He was being nice. Too nice. “How come you're being so sweet? Say something shitty.”</p>
      <p>“You want me to be mean to you?” He gave her a hard stare.</p>
      <p>“Come on, James, you know you want to.”</p>
      <p>His eyes narrowed. “You’re pretty with your hair all messed up.”</p>
      <p>“Thanks.”</p>
      <p>“You're welcome, angel.” His gaze drifted to her chest. “My tee looks hot on you
         too.”</p>
      <p>She looked down. The words Red Hot Chili Peppers emblazoned the front of the shirt—not
         the clothes she’d dressed in the night before.</p>
      <p>“You should see your expression right now.” He chuckled. “I've been waiting for you
         to
         notice. I'm disappointed in your powers of observation.”</p>
      <p>“Did you undress me?” she asked, her voice rising.</p>
      <p>“Hush.” He pressed a finger to his lips. “Maury undressed you—and cleaned you up.
         She
         fed you two aspirins and even got you to brush your teeth. A new toothbrush of course.”
         James shook his head. “I can't believe you don't remember. You had an illuminating
         conversation with her about cats.”</p>
      <p>Cats? What the heck? The last part of the evening was a blur. “Who's Maury?”</p>
      <p>“She lives upstairs. Her name’s actually Maureen, and she loves me to death.” He
         shrugged like he couldn’t explain his appeal.</p>
      <p>“Really?” Caleb never mentioned anyone named Maureen. “Why didn't she visit you in
         the
         hospital?”</p>
      <p>“What makes you think she didn't?” He beamed. “Where do you think I got the smokes?”</p>
      <p>And probably the pills. She decidedly did not like Maury. Besides, how important could
         she be to James if Caleb didn't know she existed? Her stomach twisted. Who was this
         girl?</p>
      <p>James’ expression turned contemplative. “She and Cal are the only people I consider
         family.”</p>
      <p>His emphasis on the word family made it clear Maury was not a romantic prospect, but
         why
         he felt the need to explain their relationship was beyond her. Her cheeks heated.
         He was
         too close, being too candid. He was too naked.</p>
      <p>“You kissed me last night?” She had to know for sure.</p>
      <p>His gaze remained steady. “I did.”</p>
      <p>“Did I like it?”</p>
      <p>His shoulders rose, a tiny shrug illustrating his uncertainty. He tilted his head
         and
         allowed his hair to obscure his smile. “I think so.”</p>
      <p>Without thought, she touched the silky strands. The soft ends curled around her fingers
         and entertained her fingertips.</p>
      <p>“I can do it again. Kiss you, that is.” He sighed.</p>
      <p>Warm breath spilled across her hand, sending a wave of heat up her arm. She let her
         hand
         drop and gave him a slight nod. Eyes closed, she waited, her heartbeat pounding in
         her
         ears.</p>
      <p>The bed creaked. His hand grazed her elbow and his breath fell hot on her cheek. “Open
         your eyes,” he whispered. “I want you to know who's kissing you.”</p>
      <p>That was not an issue. Every inch of her being, was aware who sat next to her.</p>
      <p>His lips feathered her cheek, moving downward until he reached her mouth. He paused,
         so
         close. What was he waiting for?</p>
      <p>His lips touched hers, warm then hot, then, like an explosion, hotter. The planet
         stopped spinning.</p>
      <p>Kissing him was like getting oxygen or eating candy. He made her greedy. She wanted
         more
         and she wanted it now. Arms around his neck, she pushed her mouth against his,
         demanding.</p>
      <p>He broke away, eyes wide, mouth wet with evidence of her hunger—and her breath caught.
         This was not the James she saw every day, the confident one, sure of everything he
         said
         and did. Right now, he looked as though he wouldn’t know his name, if someone asked
         him.</p>
      <p>No one ever looked at her that way. Not Caleb, or anybody back in Kansas.</p>
      <p>He jerked forward, shifting on top of her, his mouth on hers, his hand under her shirt.
         Every place he touched exploded, a series of fireworks. She moaned. Loud.</p>
      <p>Embarrassed, she pushed him back. Her brain scrambled, their legs a tangled mess,
         tied
         up in the sheet.</p>
      <p>With a loud groan, James flopped back on the mattress and flipped onto his belly,
         turning his head away from her. His back rose and fell at a rapid pace.</p>
      <p>“That was interesting,” he said, after a minute. He faced her. “Do you kiss Cal like
         that?”</p>
      <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
      <p>“I don't know. Dissolve in his arms.”</p>
      <p>“Is there something wrong with how I kiss?” She did dissolve in his arms, and now
         he
         mocked her.</p>
      <p>He groaned again.</p>
      <p>“Sorry if I'm a bad kisser.” Tears formed in her eyes. How could she be so turned
         on
         when he was so repulsed?</p>
      <p>“Christ.” His hand brushed her thigh under the sheet. “You're not a bad kisser. But
         you're not mine to kiss.”</p>
      <p>Her heart fluttered. “You like kissing me?”</p>
      <p>“I do.” James rolled to his back and propped himself up on his elbows. “I can illustrate
         if you don't believe me.” Grinning, he got to his feet.</p>
      <p>Stretched under the tight material of his boxer briefs, and pressed against his stomach,
         laid one hundred percent proof he liked her kiss. A blanket of heat engulfed her.
         Across
         her face and between her legs.</p>
      <p>“Good. I've rendered you speechless, just how I like my women.” With a wicked smile,
         he
         crawled toward her until he hovered over her body.</p>
      <p>“Stop. You're freaking me out.” She put her hands out. It was supposed to be a firm
         refusal, but his grin was adorable.</p>
      <p>“I’m just demonstrating what your lips did. You're lucky, angel, I usually sleep in
         the
         nip.”</p>
      <p>She locked her elbows. Caleb never pulled anything like this. No one did. And even
         if
         they had, no one had ever had this effect on her. It was like fighting a gravitational
         pull.</p>
      <p>“How many girls have you cornered like this?” She tried to laugh.</p>
      <p>“None. Scratch that. One. You.”</p>
      <p>“Why me?”</p>
      <p>“I'm guessing you want an honest answer.” He pulled back and looked her in the eyes.
         “Because you believe me and trust me. And you don't treat me like a colossal fuck
         up.”
         He answered fast, like he already considered it. His lips found her neck and cruised
         downward. “Don’t make me think right now.”</p>
      <p>Intent on remaining semi-upright, she dug her elbows into the mattress. She didn’t
         want
         to end up flat on the bed with him on top of her. The exact position she could tell
         he
         wanted her in.</p>
      <p>He slid down, his head against her stomach and nosed her shirt out of the way, his
         lips
         wet on her belly. His fingers slid into position along her outer thighs, under the
         legs
         of her panties. One tiny pull would remove them.</p>
      <p>“Stop,” she managed, breathing hard, her hands on his head. The pounding between her
         legs threatened to control her. James was like a tidal wave, and she could easily
         get
         sucked into his undertow.</p>
      <p>His ragged breath blanketed her belly and left her trembling.</p>
      <p>“I would have stopped without your prompting.” Appearing chastised, he sat up. “Don’t
         worry. I’m not interested in mowing Cal’s grass.”</p>
      <p>Eyes downcast, he lingered for a second then got off the bed. “I’ll be in the shower
         if
         you need me.” He disappeared through the door beside the crucifix, leaving her
         spellbound.</p>
      <p>She stared, open-mouthed at the closed door. Holy crap. What was up with him?</p>
      <p>What was up with her?</p>
      <p>She never responded to a guy like that. She needed to get out of there before she
         zombied-out and appeared naked in his bathroom.</p>
      <p>With no idea where her things were, she opened the top drawer of James’ dresser. She
         borrowed a pair of track pants and pulled the string tight. Her shoes had been
         thoughtfully placed beside the bed; her phone tucked neatly in the left.</p>
      <p>Dressed in head-to-toe, James felt intimate. She knew what color his sheets were and
         checked out his personal stuff. He shared this part of his life with her, not Caleb.</p>
      <p>But James wasn’t thinking about intimacy. It was unlikely he’d been thinking at all.
         This may be a big deal to her, but it meant nothing to him. He likes all his girls
         speechless, he said. That put things into perspective.</p>
      <p>She needed security, not heartbreak.</p>
      <p>She squeezed between the fan and the dresser and carefully opened the door. The rest
         of
         the basement was unfinished and contained two staircases. The nearest staircase, next
         to
         the washer and dryer, went up four steps then turned, making it impossible to see
         what
         waited at the top. Daylight streamed down the second set of stairs. They led her into
         a
         small backyard.</p>
      <p>James hadn’t been joking when he said she was close to home. As soon as she rounded
         his
         house, she recognized Saint Ambrose on the corner. His scent lingered in her hair.
         His
         detergent. His toothpaste. His bed…</p>
      <p>She needed a shower, and a memory wiping. If she didn’t get her crap together before
         she
         met up with Caleb, she would start the new school year, single. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
