         <h4>Chapter 39</h4>

      <p>A soft knock roused James from semi sleep. Still wrapped in the blanket, he stumbled
         to
         the door and inched it open, enough to peek out. Cassie stood on the other side.</p>
      <p>The three hours of shut eye he managed to get, hadn’t granted him enough brainpower
         to
         consider who might be knocking, and her wide eyes probably matched his. He jerked
         the
         door open and planted his feet in the middle of the threshold. “It’s seven o’clock.”</p>
      <p>Her cheeks pinkened. “I need to see Caleb.”</p>
      <p>“You don’t waste any time, do you?”</p>
      <p>Her blush turned crimson, but she raised her chin and pushed past him, leaving the
         faint
         scent of green apples to tease his senses.</p>
      <p>If he wasn’t fully awake, he was now.</p>
      <p>“It smells in here.” She knelt beside the sofa and leaned closer to Caleb.</p>
      <p>“Back off.” James plopped into the same chair he slept in. “Can’t you see he’s asleep?
         He’s had a hard night.”</p>
      <p>Cassie glanced toward the bucket of puke he’d been too tired to empty. “Is he sick?”</p>
      <p>“By his own hand,” James allowed. “I told you, he’s had a hard night. Which means
         my
         night also sucked. Not that you care.”</p>
      <p>Her gaze brushed over him. She chuckled. “You look like crap.”</p>
      <p>“And you find that funny?”</p>
      <p>“Leave it to you to make crap, appealing.”</p>
      <p>Not in the mood to be jacked around by her convoluted bullshit, he picked up his jeans.
         “I'm gonna go clean up; before I manage to scare you somehow. I’ll be in the bathroom
         if
         you want to talk.”</p>
      <p>He spent most of last night trying to read between the lines of her texts. Let her
         grapple with what was on his mind for a change. If there was any truth in the messages,
         she’d go home. If she cared, she would follow.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Halfway through his shower the door creaked open. He peeked around the curtain. Cassie’s
         back was to him as she eased the door into place.</p>
      <p>After a minute of painful silence, she asked, “what did you guys do last night?”</p>
      <p>He pulled back the shower curtain. She was on the closed toilet, elbows on her knees,
         Caleb’s broken phone in her hands.</p>
      <p>“Jeez, James, visual.” She dropped the phone onto the tank and shielded her eyes.</p>
      <p>Her reaction was hilarious. “It’s a little late to be prudish, don’t you think?”</p>
      <p>Cassie lowered her hands and looked right at him. “Maybe I don’t want to see you.”</p>
      <p>“Then why are you in my bathroom?”</p>
      <p>She shrugged. “Because maybe I want to see you.”</p>
      <p>He turned the water off and stepped onto the mat before reaching for a towel. He took
         his sweet time drying off, then wrapped the towel around his hips. Finally, he sat
         on
         the edge of the tub and examined her. “It's too early for feckin riddles.”</p>
      <p>“What happened to Caleb’s phone? Did he get any of my messages? Evidently, you got
         them.”</p>
      <p>“He got some, but not the last few.”</p>
      <p>“How can you be sure?”</p>
      <p>Despite himself, he chuckled. “I’m sure.”</p>
      <p>She widened her eyes, then narrowed them.</p>
      <p>“Stop it. I threw his effing phone. Happy?”</p>
      <p>“Threw it?” She sounded surprised. “Did you read all my messages?”</p>
      <p>What did she care what he read? She came over to make up with Caleb. And why shouldn’t
         she? He was her boyfriend. Not some messed up guy who only wanted to get laid.</p>
      <p>“Whatever,” she said when he didn’t answer. “How stupid of me to expect you to tell
         me
         anything.”</p>
      <p>He jerked to his feet; fists clenched. “I’ve been more honest with you than with anyone.
         Maybe I’m just not saying what you want to hear.” His doctor was right; girls would
         be
         the death of him.</p>
      <p>Cassie jumped from her seat, her face an angry shade of red. “What do you assume I
         want
         to hear?”</p>
      <p>“You want me to say, I want you.” She’d dropped enough hints. He stepped forward,
         backing her against the sink. “You want a relationship, something that involves
         emotions, not just sex, and you’re pissed ‘cause I won’t give it to you.”</p>
      <p>Her hands went to his chest, a weak attempt at pushing him back. “You can’t give it
         to
         me. You were right all along. It is all about sex with you. You’re not capable of
         anything else.”</p>
      <p> She threw his words back at him like tiny daggers, intending to inflict pain—and
         it
         worked.</p>
      <p>“Bugger off, Cassie,” he said, but his anger subsided into murky grayness. They were
         on
         the same side.</p>
      <p>He dropped the towel and reached for his jeans. “I’ve got to go out. Don’t you have
         school this morning, or some realm to vanish into?”</p>
      <p>“Today’s my last class.” She leaned against the sink and crossed her arms.</p>
      <p>“You can leave anytime,” he said when she didn’t move.</p>
      <p>She straightened, adding an inch to her height. “What’s the matter? Don't want to
         leave
         me here with Caleb?”</p>
      <p>He’d rather not. He lowered his head, close enough to inhale her amazing scent, and
         nestled his lips near her ear. “Admit it. You’re not scared of me. You’re scared of
         the
         way you feel about me.”</p>
      <p>Her paled complexion confirmed his accusation. Despite the texts she left, she still
         wanted him. Which was great because he could no longer deny, he clearly wanted her.</p>
      <p>“We’ll talk later, angel,” he said, “when you get back.”</p>
      <p>He needed time to figure out how he and Cassie could work, with the least amount of
         collateral damage. But it could work. He was capable of something else. And if something
         else was what she wanted; he would figure out a way to give it to her. </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
