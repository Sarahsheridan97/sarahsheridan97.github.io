         <h4>Chapter 33</h4>
      </div>
      <p>From outside the pool house window, Cassie had a clear view of James and Caleb as
         they
         relaxed at the bistro table, cards in hand. If James hung around to drive her crazy,
         it
         worked. He hadn’t spoken to her all day, not that he had to. What he’d said at the
         lake
         was enough. </p>
      <p>She pulled out her phone and thumbed, Put the cards down. I’m outside.</p>
      <p>Inside, Caleb checked his messages. His eyes flicked to the window. He said something
         to
         James, then tossed his cards onto the table.</p>
      <p>The door slammed and Caleb appeared around the corner. “What are you doing out
         here?”</p>
      <p>Wanting to make sure James hadn’t followed, she peeked through the side of the window.
         James was in his chair but turned toward the glass. Thanks to the dark sky he probably
         saw his own reflection, but she jumped back. “Can we do something without him? I’m
         tired
         of being a threesome.”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s brows shot up, indicating her word choice sucked.</p>
      <p>“Sure,” he said, one brow still raised. “He knows you’re out here, by the way.”</p>
      <p>The statement dangled between them. She checked the house again. The room was empty.</p>
      <p>“He’s not in his chair.” She braced herself for James impromptu appearance.</p>
      <p>“Jesus, Cassie. He’s probably in the can.” Caleb shook his head. “He’s got plans in
         an
         hour. Come by then.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p> ***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Caleb’s idea of doing something became a retro movie. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
         had
         been awful, not that the title got her hopes up. Caleb did all the right boyfriend
         things—held her hand and bought her popcorn—but every so often, she caught him watching
         her, forehead furrowed.</p>
      <p>“Do you mind if I make a quick stop?” he asked as they sat in the idling Charger.
         It was
         the only thing he’d said since they’d left the theater.</p>
      <p>“Sure,” she said, though she’d rather go back to the pool house. The first drops of
         rain
         splattered the windshield making it a good night to spend together, under a blanket,
         listening to thunder.</p>
      <p>“Ten minutes.” He crossed his heart. “I promise.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A barrage of convoluted alley shortcuts dumped them into a dense fog. They rolled
         to a
         stop on a barely lit street lined with abandoned warehouses.</p>
      <p>Caleb parallel parked behind Allison’s purple Volkswagen bug, a surprise as it didn’t
         seem like a place anyone would want to be, let alone Allison.</p>
      <p>“It smells like wet metal,” she said as she followed Caleb alongside the front of
         a tall
         brick building, its bottom windows painted black. They had to be near water, but she
         didn’t recall looping east.</p>
      <p>“It’s all the factories.” Caleb stopped in front of a large, metal door. “James claims
         it smells like old money, but it reminds me of urban decay.” Using both hands, he
         slid
         the door sideways. The castors squeaked and the door thudded against its stop.</p>
      <p>The room they stepped into may have been an office sixty years ago. The only light
         came
         from a battery-powered lantern placed in the middle of an old, wood desk. Two boys
         stood
         in the corner, shadows amongst a collection of vinyl chairs. The sixties colors of
         lemon
         yellow and lime green were muted in the dullness.</p>
      <p>Caleb gave them a friendly nod. The taller, dark-haired boy pointed at a doorway.
         “Party’s that way,” he said.</p>
      <p>Another lantern lit a long, narrow hallway with multiple doors. The light didn’t reach
         the end, but the last room on the left emanated an eerie glow. Soft, folk music drifted
         toward them.</p>
      <p>The door beside Caleb jerked open. A boy stuck his shaved head out, smoke billowed
         around him.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Caleb.” He grinned. “I thought I heard the front door slam. Want something to
         drink?”</p>
      <p>“Dex.” Caleb gave him a guy-shake then motioned for her to follow.</p>
      <p>This room wasn’t any bigger than the first. A large peace sign decorated the far wall,
         along with the greeting, Welcome to the Cove. The walls were covered in hundreds of
         names and quotes. She couldn’t read them in the flickering candlelight, but since
         most
         of them were written in blood-red, the room looked like a scene from Helter Skelter.</p>
      <p>She was beginning to feel like a sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Long tables had been shaped into a T, but there were no chairs. A group of guys and
         a
         couple girls clustered around the last table, listening to a taller version of shaved
         head, Dex, tell an animated story. A couple faces were recognizable from summer school,
         but Allie wasn’t amongst them.</p>
      <p>She nudged Caleb. “Do you know what they’re talking about?”</p>
      <p>Shrugging, Caleb heaved himself onto the table next to a cooler. He snubbed out the
         candle closest to him. “You want something?”</p>
      <p>“No thanks.”</p>
      <p>The smell of incense burnt her nose. She coughed, then sneezed three times in
         succession. The Dex look-a-like stopped talking and glared at her. One of the girls
         laughed.</p>
      <p>Cassie edged toward the door. “I’ll go see if I can find Allie.”</p>
      <p>“Okay,” Caleb said, with the same puzzled look he’d worn all day. “I’ll be right behind
         you.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The last room on the left resembled a furniture warehouse.</p>
      <p>The moon shone through a wall of tall metal windows and danced off hundreds of plastic
         stars dangled from the ceiling. They swayed in the breeze from the moving bodies below.
         She headed to the windows. Sure enough, they overlooked a body of water, but it wasn’t
         Lake Michigan.</p>
      <p>There were too many people to spot Allie. Cassie pulled out her phone. Hey. I saw
         your
         car. I’m in this creepy room with stars. Are you here too?</p>
      <p>Furniture had been grouped into private sections, each with its own lantern. Most
         of the
         areas, she discovered, were occupied by sleeping bodies or couples making out. She
         even
         stumbled upon an ongoing game of monopoly.</p>
      <p>She was about to give up but a dangling hand, over the arm of a large chair, caught
         her
         eye. From ten feet away, the tattoos on the fingers were impossible to read, but she
         knew in her heart the letters spelled Take.</p>
      <p>Of course, James was there. She should have known.</p>
      <p>Ignoring the beep from her phone, she stepped to the side for a better view. James
         sat,
         semi-upright with his head down. He wasn’t awake, and he wasn’t alone. A blonde girl
         gyrated on top of him. The bottom curve of her breasts visible under the hem of her
         midriff shirt.</p>
      <p>Cassie crept closer—but the girl never took her eyes off James. She popped the top
         button on his shirt, then the next.</p>
      <p>Every button the girl undid, twisted something in Cassie’s stomach. With any luck,
         James
         wore one of his rock t shirts, but when the girl spread his shirt, his chest was
         bare.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” Caleb had crept up behind her.</p>
      <p>She pointed to James. “What is wrong with that girl? He isn’t interested.”</p>
      <p>“You’re assuming he's not.”</p>
      <p>“Doesn’t being unconscious qualify as not interested?”</p>
      <p>Caleb huffed. “James is a big boy, and he got along fine before you took this odd
         interest in his wellbeing. You didn’t even want to see him tonight.”</p>
      <p>She hadn’t. But that didn’t mean she wanted to see this, either.</p>
      <p>The girl ran her hands downward, stopping at the button of James’ jeans. She looked
         around lazily before undoing it.</p>
      <p>Cassie clenched her fingers into fists. “Caleb, stop her.” The girl was coming off
         if
         she had to knock her off, herself. “You know how much he hates to be touched.”</p>
      <p>“I do.” Caleb stared down at her. “The question is, how do you know that?”</p>
      <p>Her cheeks heated. “You… told me.”</p>
      <p>Caleb studied her a few seconds then strode to James. “Get off him.”</p>
      <p>Ignoring Caleb, the girl wrapped her arms around James’ waist. She pressed her head
         against his belly.</p>
      <p>James' eyelids fluttered. “What are you doing, Cassie?”</p>
      <p>He called the girl Cassie.</p>
      <p>Cassie’s stomach gurgled, then rose to the back of her throat. Her knees weakened
         as a
         red-faced Caleb hooked the girl’s waist and pulled.</p>
      <p>“Go,” he said, then booted James’ legs off the table. “Get up.”</p>
      <p>James jumped to his feet. He swayed back and forth, his chest heaving, until he zeroed
         in on Caleb and visibly relaxed. “What the feck, Cal?” He sunk into the chair and
         leaned
         forward, head in his hands.</p>
      <p>Caleb strode to her. “Explain why when my best friend thinks he’s about to get his
         dick
         sucked, he thinks it’s you?”</p>
      <p>Her intake of breath whistled; she couldn’t get enough oxygen. “I… don’t know why.”
         She
         took his hand. He allowed it, but it lay awkward in her grip</p>
      <p>Caleb pulled her into the hallway, then yanked his hand free. “I’m getting a huge
         headache. Allison’s in there. Can you get a ride with her?”</p>
      <p>“You’re leaving me here?” He couldn’t go. She needed to explain things, or lie about
         things, or sell her soul.</p>
      <p>“I need time to think.” His gaze flicked to her. “Is there something you want to tell
         me? Anything? James won’t lie to me. He won't protect you.”</p>
      <p>She wrapped her arms around herself and shook her head. “No. Nothing… Please, Caleb...
         No one’s at my house. I'm all alone.”</p>
      <p>“Damn it.” He hugged her, but his arms were a loose loop that held no warmth. Stepping
         back, he thrust his chin toward the backroom. “James is fucked-up, and I’m not leaving
         him here. Stay with Allison tonight. She… heard. You can hang with her.”</p>
      <p>“I want to be with you.”</p>
      <p>Caleb headed to the doorway. Turning, he gave her a sad smile. “I believe the exact
         words were you don't want to be alone.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>She took a second to calm her breathing, then stumbled into the room. Allison waited
         by
         the door alongside her friend, Emily.</p>
      <p>“Are you okay?” Allison asked. “I heard what James said.”</p>
      <p>Cassie couldn’t answer. If she opened her mouth, she might throw up.</p>
      <p>Caleb approached. James followed, shirt undone, eyes downcast. He slumped against
         the
         wall.</p>
      <p>“So, you’re going to Allison’s?” Caleb confirmed.</p>
      <p>“Yes.” Allison put her arm around Cassie. “It’ll be fun. My parents are at my sister's
         in Crystal Lake. You guys should stop by later.”</p>
      <p>Cassie wanted to shrink into the floor. Like they’d come over now. Neither of them
         wanted anything to do with her.</p>
      <p>“We’ll pass.” Caleb confirmed her worst fear but bumped her hand with his. “I’ll call.
         Just give me some space right now.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Relax,” Allison said when they were alone. She handed Cassie a wrinkled Kleenex from
         her purse. “Things will get straightened out. It’s not like you’ve done something
         wrong.”</p>
      <p>But she did do something wrong. She gambled security for one night with a guy who’d
         made
         it clear he wasn’t an option.</p>
      <p>Rain hid her tears as she walked down the street. The spot behind Allison’s bug was
         empty. Caleb abandoned her. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
