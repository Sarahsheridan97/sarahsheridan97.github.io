      <p>They laid still for what seemed like a long time, then James peeled himself off and
         cool
         air touched her damp skin. He buried his head into his drawn-up knees.</p>
      <p>“What’s wrong?” she asked</p>
      <p>He shot her a pained look. “You have a hickey on your neck. Guess Cal didn't get the
         same lecture.”</p>
      <p>She touched her collarbone, the spot where Caleb sucked the longest. “It's just a
         hickey. It doesn’t mean anything.”</p>
      <p>Nothing compared to what she just experienced. She touched his back, but he scooted
         forward, telling her the hickey stood for much more—and she knew it</p>
      <p>“That makes me mad for Cal—and angry with him for getting to do what he wants when
         I got
         a warning.” He faced her, his eyes vacant. “You should go.”</p>
      <p>“Go?”</p>
      <p>“That’s what I said. G.O. Go.” He pulled on jeans then retrieved a cigar box from
         the
         top drawer of his dresser. He stuck a blunt between his lips.</p>
      <p>Her heart sputtered. She caught his gaze through the mirror. “You’re doing this on
         purpose.”</p>
      <p>“Doing what? Put some fucking clothes on.”</p>
      <p>“This is how you respond when you're hurt. I've seen you pull this crap on Caleb a
         hundred times.”</p>
      <p>Reluctant to get out of bed, she grabbed a tee off the floor. A loud shattering made
         her
         jump, and she yanked the cotton material past her eyes.</p>
      <p>Sharp angles of glass were all that remained of the mirror. Blood dripped from James’
         knuckles as he gripped the edge of the dresser. She rushed to inspect his hand. For
         a
         second, he tolerated her, then stomped into the bathroom. He returned with his hand
         wrapped in a towel, snatched the cigar box, then headed to the sofa. Like a zombie,
         she
         followed.</p>
      <p>“You’re scaring me.” She climbed onto his lap.</p>
      <p>“Then leave. I know you hate to see me get high.” He lit the joint and held the smoke
         in
         until he coughed. “We’re done.”</p>
      <p>“Done?” The word sounded foreign. “You just told me you loved me.”</p>
      <p>“A guy will say anything to get laid.”</p>
      <p>“You don’t mean that.” Her stomach churned. “Kiss me.”</p>
      <p>Her attempt to chase down his lips turned into a desperate peck on his cheek.</p>
      <p>“Cassie, stop.” He rested his head against the cushion. “I can't do this anymore.
         I want
         someone I know is mine. I need something normal. You know, watching TV and stuff.”</p>
      <p>“TV.” It sounded ludicrous coming from him. “You want to watch TV… with who? Emily?”
         Her
         heart would beat out of her chest if he didn’t take those words back. “You’re not
         supposed to be in a relationship, remember?”</p>
      <p>His eyebrows rose, but he shrugged. “I don't want this anymore.” He brought his arm
         over
         his eyes. “Don’t make me force you to leave.”</p>
      <p>She tugged his elbow until he lowered his arm, then linked her fingers through his.
         “You
         can’t tell me you don't want me.”</p>
      <p>“I don't want you.” The words rolled easily from his mouth, his gaze on hers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie slid off his knee and stumbled into the bathroom. She slammed the door. Her
         clothes lay beside the tub, like nothing changed.</p>
      <p>James didn’t acknowledge her when she stepped out. A bottle sat on the coffee table
         in
         front of him.</p>
      <p>“Great, James. Get wasted. That’s what you’re good at.” She stomped past him into
         the
         late morning sun.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>For the first time, she was glad her house was empty. She laid across the coffee table,
         the cool wood soothing. Its form solid enough to keep her from drowning. She sobbed
         until exhausted, and fell asleep.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Cassie. Cassie, are you all right?” Caleb peered down at her. “Your front door was
         open—and you're sleeping on the table.”</p>
      <p>She inched up, then deflated as the morning’s events injected a fresh jolt of
         misery.</p>
      <p>Caleb sat on the sofa and pulled her onto his knees. “Shh. You’re okay. What
         happened?”</p>
      <p>“I got in a fight with my mom,” she said, though she had no idea if her mom was in
         town.
         “What time is it?”</p>
      <p>“Almost one?” Caleb rubbed her back. “Wait here.” He padded down the hall and returned
         with a damp cloth and a glass of water. He dabbed the cloth to her face and produced
         a
         couple of aspirins from his pocket. “Here.”</p>
      <p>She sniffled. “You're good at this.”</p>
      <p>“I’m considering a career in medicine. I got into Notre Dame.”</p>
      <p>It was something she should have known, but they’d never discussed plans after high
         school. All they did this summer was party. The real world evaporated.</p>
      <p>Although she just woke up, she yawned. “Can we go to the pool house? I don't want
         to
         stay in this empty place.”</p>
      <p>“Sure,” he said, “but James might show up.”</p>
      <p>Cassie choked back a sob. Did Emily comfort James somewhere like Caleb comforted her?
         “Do you know where he is?”</p>
      <p>“I haven’t heard from him since the other night.” Caleb sighed, an all too familiar
         sound. “It's never good when he disappears.” </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
