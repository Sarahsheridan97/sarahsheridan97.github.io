      </div>
      <p>James was awake for a while, trying to figure out his location from reflections in
         the
         tinted glass. Giving up, he popped the seat and checked out the window. “Where are
         you
         taking me?”</p>
      <p>Caleb jumped. “When did you wake up?”</p>
      <p>“Just now. Where are we going?” They were north of the city, following the contour
         of
         the lake southward. An unusual way to get home from Rockford, and through his childhood
         neighborhood.</p>
      <p>“To the beach,” Caleb admitted.</p>
      <p>He sounded hesitant, like he realized he would get flack, rightfully so. The closer
         James got to the southside, the more he wanted to crawl into bed and sleep. Forever.</p>
      <p>James groaned. “Seriously, Cal? I’m wearing jeans.”</p>
      <p>“I brought you shorts and a shirt… flip-flops… beach chairs… and towels.”</p>
      <p>“Does this outing include alcohol?” He could hope.</p>
      <p>“Nope. I just scoped out a party for tomorrow night, up here in Edgewater, and I won't
         say a word if you cut loose. But can we stay sober today? Just us, the sun, and the
         water, checking out the talent. Five days of abstinence must have you wound pretty
         tight.”</p>
      <p>James turned back to the window. One girl haunted him all week, and mercifully, it
         didn’t sound like she was on the beach.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Should I buy a boat?” The sound of the surf, and the sun hot on James’ back, made
         drifting away feel like an actual possibility.</p>
      <p>“That would be cool.” Caleb’s voice came from behind, where he’d set his chair on
         higher
         ground. “Girls love to party on boats.”</p>
      <p>“Girls?” Waves splashed James’ calves and soaked the ass of his shorts. He moved his
         chair and settled down beside Caleb. “Did you and Cassie get into a fight?”</p>
      <p>“I hardly saw her.” Caleb’s face remained blank. “She spent most of the week studying
         for her session one final. But since you brought her up, I wanted to talk to you about
         the hospital.”</p>
      <p>“I wasn't rude to her, I swear it.”</p>
      <p>“She hasn't complained. In fact, she hasn't said much about anything.”</p>
      <p>“What's your issue then?” James ran his fingers through his hair. Everything about
         Cassie had become a problem.</p>
      <p>“I didn't say there was something wrong. Damn.” Caleb pulled two bottles of water
         from
         the small cooler and tossed him one. “I want to apologize for siccing her on you.”</p>
      <p>The hospital weekend remained fresh in James’ memory. He’d almost kissed Cassie. He
         should be the one apologizing. “She rode in the back of the ambulance,” he said, “I
         think they stripped me naked.”</p>
      <p>“Naked? As in completely?”</p>
      <p>“There’s no such thing as privacy when you’re bleeding to death. I woke up in a backless
         gown with tubes sticking out of me. Everywhere.”</p>
      <p>“Shit. “Caleb shook his head. “It’s just… I saw them secure you to that board thing,
         and
         I knew. I knew you would be terrified when you woke up if you couldn’t move. I didn't
         want you to be alone. I’m not sure what Cassie saw. I can ask her if you want?”</p>
      <p>“Hell no! Leave it alone. I want her to forget the whole experience.”</p>
      <p>He’d love to forget also—but one question festered in his gut all week. It wouldn’t
         go
         away, no matter how much iron he pumped or how much pain he was in. He kept his gaze
         on
         the far horizon, where Indiana’s, Mount Baldy was visible across the state line. “So,
         did you hit that ride on Sunday?”</p>
      <p>“I told you. I hardly saw her.”</p>
      <p>“Did she find out you model?” Something was different.</p>
      <p>Caleb turned toward him. “She’ll find out soon enough when school starts. Might as
         well
         wait.”</p>
      <p>“She'll be pissed if she hears it elsewhere. Girls hate being lied to.”</p>
      <p>“I'm not lying to her.” Caleb crinkled his bottle and threw it into the cooler. “She
         doesn’t need to know everything about me.”</p>
      <p>Cassie did not deserve to be lied to, but him and Caleb could not get on the same
         page
         when it came to her. James stood. He needed something to keep his brain engaged and
         his
         mouth shut. Caleb was right about one thing. Half-naked girls were all over the
         place.</p>
      <p>“See those girls playing volleyball?” He chinned to the small group about sixty feet
         away. “They’ve been giving us the glad eye since we sat down.”</p>
      <p>Caleb twisted to look over his shoulder. A red-haired girl waved at them.</p>
      <p>James waved back. “If we don't go over there, they'll come here. I’d rather go there
         so
         we can ditch them when we want.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Five volleyball games later, James laid his towel on the warm sand and stretched out
         on
         his belly. He turned away from where Cal sat, snuggled with the redhead, riotously
         named
         Amber. He didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to recognize Cal was looking to get
         laid—and he wanted no part of it.</p>
      <p>A shadow cast over him, and a foot prodded his ribs. “Wake up.”</p>
      <p>He ignored Caleb’s foot the same as he ignored the blonde girl that crept onto the
         edge
         of his towel.</p>
      <p>“I know you’re not sleeping,” Caleb said, his voice next to James’ ear.</p>
      <p>James rolled over and sat up. He pressed his forehead against his knees. What part
         of
         tired did Caleb fail to understand? Probably the same part that forgot what taken
         meant.</p>
      <p>The blonde claimed more real estate on his towel. What the hell was her name? Not
         that
         he gave a shit. Standing, he brushed sand from his body. “This is great, but I’m gonna
         head out.”</p>
      <p>The blonde sighed in protest as he strode to fold up his chair. Caleb came up behind
         him. “In case you failed to notice, these girls are hot, into us, and getting
         shitfaced.”</p>
      <p>“I noticed the shitfaced part. Thanks for policing me tonight so I couldn't join
         them.”</p>
      <p>Caleb groaned. “Great, now you're pissed at me.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not mad.” James yawned. “Get Ronnie to be your winger, he won’t blab. But I’m
         tired, and one of us should check on Mom. Maybe I’ll watch a movie with her.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not calling Ron.” Caleb glanced toward the girls. “The redhead’s hot, and Mary’s
         into you. What if we go someplace relaxing? Party of four. Red’s hungry and I promised
         I'd take her to eat.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not going anywhere.” And neither should you, not that he’d ever say that.</p>
      <p>“Stop looking at me like that,” Caleb said, “it’s been a weird week. I thought Cassie
         wanted to screw around, then she did this complete about-face. Jesus. She’s confusing
         the hell out of me.”</p>
      <p>James stifled a small smile, Cassie hadn’t slept with Cal. He raised his eyebrow.
         “Maybe
         you weren’t persuasive enough.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever.” Caleb stepped toward the girls. “I’d rather get it elsewhere than push
         her.
         Besides, it’s just dinner. I'll be home right behind you.”</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>James waited until he was in the Uber to turn his phone on. It was against the rules
         to
         have it the first three days of rehab, and after that, it had to be checked out from
         the
         desk. He hadn’t cared. The person he wanted to talk to would only make his life more
         difficult.</p>
      <p>Most of his messages were from Alexa. He deleted them, leaving them unread.</p>
      <p>There was a voicemail from Cassie. His finger lingered over the delete button before
         he
         pressed play.</p>
      <p>“Hope you’re enjoying your day in the sun. Have fun.”</p>
      <p>So, Caleb shared his kidnapping plan with her. The image of them conspiring twisted
         his
         stomach. He turned his phone off and shoved it into his pocket.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Hey.” The driver nudged his shoulder. “Wake up.”</p>
      <p>They were parked in Caleb’s driveway. He must be completely messed-up to fall asleep
         in
         the ten minutes since they stopped for snacks.</p>
      <p>“James.” Elizabeth sat up from where she’d stretched across the sofa. “I didn't expect
         to see you till tomorrow. Where's Cal? He's supposed to be with you.”</p>
      <p>“I released him of his duties. Want to watch a movie?” He held up the chips, hopeful.
         “Can I stay in here tonight?” The last thing he needed was a midnight visit from
         Cassie.</p>
      <p>“It's your room. You never need to ask.” She swung her feet to the floor. “I'll get
         a
         bowl.”</p>
      <p>“I'll get it.” Her headache was his fault. It was the least he could do.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>On autopilot, he scanned for a comedy. Cal’s mom hated horror and enjoyed a better
         sense
         of humor than her son. Besides, he wanted to fall asleep to laughter.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, for making you sick,” he said and meant it. Elizabeth was nothing but kind
         to
         him. Back when bouts of anxiety-induced vomiting were a weekly occurrence, she would
         sit
         outside the locked bathroom door trying to talk him down.</p>
      <p>Back before he learned the placating effects of alcohol.</p>
      <p>Half asleep, he stretched to touch her hand. “I don’t mean to make you suffer. I never
         meant to hurt my real mom either. But no matter what I did, she paid.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth drew a sharp breath and seemed to hold it.</p>
      <p>The opening credits blurred. He fell asleep before she exhaled. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
