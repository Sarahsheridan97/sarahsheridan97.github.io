      </div>
      <p>Caleb held the Charger’s door open for his mom. She climbed into the passenger seat
         and
         released a broken sob. The fifth one since they’d left James. Not that he counted.</p>
      <p>He slumped in his seat and rested his forehead against the leather steering wheel
         cover,
         warm from the afternoon sun. “Can’t we just tell Dr. Madison James changed his mind?
         He
         needs family, not strangers.”</p>
      <p>“He made the right decision, Cal.” Elizabeth fastened her seatbelt, a cue to start
         the
         engine.</p>
      <p>Leaving James in the hospital when they were ten, sucked. Leaving him now wasn’t any
         easier. It wasn’t fair. James never drove away from him; or had to face the truth—your
         best efforts to save someone—weren’t good enough.</p>
      <p>“I know this isn’t easy,” Elizabeth said, “but for the first time in years, I can
         relax.
         I don’t have to worry about getting a call like this—or worse. They’ll watch him
         there.”</p>
      <p>“I watch him,” Caleb muttered, only he hadn’t been. Not since Cassie came into the
         picture. He swiped the back of his hand over his eyes then shoved the key into the
         ignition. He was in no condition to drive, but one glance at his mom told him neither
         was she. Her eyes were shut, two fingers pressed between her brows. A sure sign one
         of
         her headaches loomed on the horizon.</p>
      <p>“James needs more than you watching him. I’m worried he’s getting worse instead of
         better.” She faced him. “What was he doing in that alley?”</p>
      <p>They had this conversation when she picked him up from the police station, at a much
         higher volume. When he pleaded the fifth, she’d asked outright, ‘Is your brother dealing
         drugs? Taking drugs? Are you?’ He was pretty sure his mom knew more than he did at
         this
         point, and hoped-for disclaimers. He couldn’t provide those, either.</p>
      <p>He shook his head. “James isn’t telling me anything.”</p>
      <p>“Dr. Madison mentioned Cassie spent the weekend at the hospital.”</p>
      <p>“James doesn’t like her much, but…” Having Cassie stay with James may not have been
         ideal. They bickered constantly— fighting over him. But at the time, handcuffed in
         the
         alley, he was out of options. He gave the Charger a jolt of gas. “I’m not sure where
         you’re going with this, Mom.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth massaged her temples. “Does she know anything about his past?”</p>
      <p>“Not unless he told her.” Highly unlikely. Caleb honked at the car in front of him.
         Talking about Cassie was off-limits. She was all his. Her attention wasn’t divided.
         He
         didn’t need to be the perfect one, the one that never got into trouble, because he
         was
         the only one.</p>
      <p>“Why are you asking about Cassie?”</p>
      <p>“You seem serious about her,” his mother said, “I’m just checking in on how you’re
         doing.”</p>
      <p>That didn’t happen very often. His eyes skated over her, a brief assessment before
         focusing back on traffic. “Relax, Mom. I’m fine.”</p>
      <p>No matter how hard he tried, he failed at giving James, or his mother, what they needed.
         But tonight, when Cassie stopped by, he could give her what she wanted.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie showed up twenty minutes late, in track pants and an oversized tee. It wasn’t
         the
         attire he expected from someone who’d made her evening’s itinerary clear.</p>
      <p>She stood by the end of the sofa and sniffed the air. “Did you clean?”</p>
      <p>“I did,” Caleb admitted, “and I picked you flowers.” He pointed to the bistro table
         where he vased a small bouquet of his mother’s lilies.</p>
      <p>She frowned at the flowers, then, with a weak smile, plunked onto the cushion. “How’s
         James?”</p>
      <p>“He’s James. We left the hospital early. I think he wanted to be left alone.”</p>
      <p>“Did he seem okay to you?”</p>
      <p>“He looks like shit, and he’s going to rehab. I think he expected our mom to try to
         talk
         him out of it—but she didn’t.” He sat beside her. “Let’s talk about you and me.”</p>
      <p>“What about us?”</p>
      <p>“About what you said at the hospital. You said you’d make me feel better.” He picked
         up
         her hand. “I’ve decided to let you.”</p>
      <p>“Let me?” She yanked her hand free and clambered to her feet. “I remember what I said.
         I
         didn’t realize how exhausted I’d be.”</p>
      <p>He’d worded that wrong, but the expression on her face made him feel like she wasn’t
         interested in him at all. He jumped to his feet. “What the hell, Cassie? You’ve wanted
         sex since I met you. What’s your problem?”</p>
      <p>“Maybe I’m tired.” Her eyes widened. “From dealing with your asshole friend. This
         would
         never have happened if you hadn’t gotten so drunk.”</p>
      <p>The accusation stung because she was right. He slumped against the cushions. “What
         do
         you want to do, because I’m sure as hell not begging you for sex.”</p>
      <p>“Good, because you’re not getting any.” She inched toward the door then paused. “I
         shouldn’t have implied you are to blame. It’s not your fault James is where he is.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever.” He couldn’t look at her.</p>
      <p>“I’ll call you after class tomorrow,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, sure.” He rested his head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
