      </div>
      <p>James’ bicep twitched as the makeup artist rubbed another layer of concealer over
         the
         letters FTW scrolled across his left forearm. She worked downward, toward his wrist
         where his favorite tat, a depiction of Van Gogh’s skull smoking a joint, camouflaged
         a
         fair amount of scar tissue.</p>
      <p>He would never have taken this modeling gig had he known they would censor his ink,
         and
         his wrist was the last place he wanted to be groped.</p>
      <p>With a slow inhale he planted his feet flat on the floor and focused on the hum of
         the
         industrial fan. After seven years of therapy, he ought to be able to calm himself
         down—without dissociating. But he couldn’t.</p>
      <p>His heart thudded and despite the circulating air, the room grew warmer by the minute.
         He needed help.</p>
      <p>Luckily, it was close by.</p>
      <p>With a slight twist, he attempted to make urgent eye contact with his friend Caleb
         who
         sat one chair over, dressed, ready for the photo shoot.</p>
      <p>But Caleb, who always had James’ back, missed the SOS.</p>
      <p>Instead, he stared downward, toward his knees, at the open pages of a discarded
         Cosmopolitan magazine. Weird reading material, even for Caleb, but something had been
         off with him since school let out for summer. He was too quiet, even distant, and
         no
         matter how much James tried, two weeks of prying hadn’t loosened Cal’s tongue.</p>
      <p>James cleared his throat—but got nothing. His stomach tightened.</p>
      <p>“Stay still, por favor.” The woman frowned as her fingers skimmed Van Gogh. “Almost
         done.”</p>
      <p>A familiar shiver trickled down James’ spine. One he’d been taught to notice. A warning.
         He needed out of the chair. Now. Before she asked what happened to his wrist—or didn’t
         ask—and assumed the worst.</p>
      <p>Slouching forward, hand on his groin, he flashed his most persuasive smile. “Skip
         that
         one…” He scanned her lanyard. “Cierra. I’ve gotta piss.”</p>
      <p>She glanced at his pants but shook her head. “You’re not moving ‘til I finish your
         arm.”</p>
      <p>Trapped.</p>
      <p>The air around him tightened. His body teetered weightless as his mind fought for
         distance.</p>
      <p>In a last-ditch attempt at staying corporeal he doodled circles on the smooth surface
         of
         the mirrored vanity, with the index finger of his free hand. Another grounding
         technique, straight from his shrink.</p>
      <p>The exercise helped until Cierra thumbed the patch of skin still sensitive from nerve
         damage. Nausea rolled over him and a tiny whimper squeezed through his clamped jaw.</p>
      <p>Screw grounding himself. Dr. Madison didn’t know shit. If he didn’t disconnect, he’d
         knock Cierra on her ass. Once he spaced out, she could do what she wanted with his
         body.</p>
      <p>A familiar haze crept over him.</p>
      <p>“James. Stay with us.” With a loud sigh, Caleb let the magazine slide from his knees.
         He
         thumped over it as he rolled closer. “Stop messing with him. I heard your instructions.
         Cover everything R rated, leave the rest.”</p>
      <p>The tightness in James’ chest lightened. Help at last.</p>
      <p>“What does Nár laga Dia do lámh, mean?” Cierra’s Spanish tongue slaughtered the Irish
         verse twisted around a Celtic cross; its’ bottom point suspended above Van Gogh.</p>
      <p>“Leave it.” Caleb’s voice was flat.</p>
      <p>“May God not weaken your hand,” James answered, the conversation a means to keep him
         in
         his body, on planet Earth.</p>
      <p>Where—according to everyone—he needed to be.</p>
      <p>Cierra selected a foundation brush from the adjacent table. “All these tattoos must
         limit your work opportunities.”</p>
      <p>“Bloody hell, Cal.” James closed his eyes as the brush assaulted his skin, but he
         was no
         longer on high alert. He’d passed that torch to Cal. “I’ll never be gainfully employed.
         Whatever will I do?”</p>
      <p>Caleb chuckled.</p>
      <p>Cierra didn’t. She tapped the serpent on the inside of his right forearm. “I do like
         the
         snake, though.”</p>
      <p>Twisted into a knot and dangling a clover from its mouth, the serpent was James’ biggest
         tattoo. It hid a long, straight scar—newer than the rest—but like most of his others,
         he
         was clueless how he got it.</p>
      <p>Not that he cared.</p>
      <p>He turned toward Cierra’s voice. “All the girls like my snake, CiCi.” He waited for
         Cal’s rebuke, reining him in, telling him he’d gone too far, but got nothing.</p>
      <p>“Keep your eyes—and mouth—closed, chaval.” Cierra shielded his nose and blasted his
         arm
         with setting spray.</p>
      <p>He knocked her hand away. “I’m eighteen. Legal. In case you were… curious.” He wasn’t
         eighteen yet, but she didn't know that.</p>
      <p>“All done.” Her voice came from his right. “They’re still setting up in the next room.
         Give your arms a minute to set, then get dressed. They’ll send for you guys, soon.”</p>
      <p>James kept his eyes closed but smiled. He’d managed his stress without dissociating.
         Sure, he had some help, but only a wee bit. Now that it was over, he felt certain
         he
         could have handled it on his own.</p>
      <p>He sucked in a breath and exhaled, rolling the remaining tension from his shoulders.
         “What do you think, Callie? You’re staring holes through me. Do I look as prom worthy
         as
         you?”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s seat squeaked. “How would you know what I’m looking at? Your eyes are shut.”</p>
      <p>James opened his eyes. Sure enough, Cierra stood at the other table, cleaning her
         supplies, and as he guessed, Caleb stared at him from his chair, his happy pink shirt
         and white cummerbund at odds with the tightness in his jaw.</p>
      <p>“How would you know my eyes were shut if you weren’t looking?” It was unarguable logic
         and he waited for a smart-ass reply, but Caleb only scratched the back of his neck
         and
         turned toward the long wall of windows. They were high enough up to see Lake Michigan,
         sandwiched between Chicago’s metal skyline. Scenic, sure, but it didn’t warrant more
         than a two-second glance.</p>
      <p>James unstuck himself from the sweaty confines of the chair’s black vinyl and scooped
         up
         the Cosmo magazine. Are you an enabler? the cover enquired. He dropped it on Cierra’s
         table then strolled across the wood floor, toward a metal rack containing the required
         outfits. The first shirt tagged for him, Fitzpatrick, was black with silver pinstripes.
         He slipped it on, leaving it unbuttoned.</p>
      <p>“Keep the sleeves loose for now.” Cierra’s gaze lingered on his Irish Republican Army
         tattoo, half-visible above the low waistband of his trousers. Her complexion darkened.
         “So, how long have you two been a couple?”</p>
      <p>“I like women.” James sat down. “Older ones.” He pushed his hips forward, letting
         the
         flat front pants illustrate his package.</p>
      <p>“We’re brothers,” Caleb offered, still facing the windows.</p>
      <p>They weren’t brothers and looked nothing alike. But James smiled at the term of
         endearment Cal picked up from the three and a half years James lived with him, courtesy
         of the Department of Children and Family Services.</p>
      <p>“Twins,” James added, “identical.” He searched Cierra’s face for a reaction.</p>
      <p>She dropped a bag of brushes into her tote, then clicked off the tripod light. “I’ve
         heard all about you, James. Including how old you are.”</p>
      <p>“Great. She’s been warned about you.” Caleb faced him. “I’m surprised you haven’t
         gotten
         fired yet.”</p>
      <p>James dug his smokes out of his backpack. Cierra didn’t know shit about him, and Cal,
         who knew everything about him, needed to chill. Cigarette between his lips, he spun
         the
         chair on its axis. After a couple lazy rotations, he stopped and leveled his gaze
         at
         Cierra.</p>
      <p>“So what do you think? Me and you…”</p>
      <p>Cierra lowered her bright pink tote to the floor and extended the handle. “Aren’t
         you
         dating Alexa Petrov?”</p>
      <p>“Dún do bheal.” Caleb pointed at James; his brows pulled into a stern blond line.
         “He’s
         kidding. Tell her you’re not serious—and not breaking the agency no dating rules.”</p>
      <p>James chuckled. Cal telling him to shut his mouth in Irish sounded as funny as Cierra’s
         use of the word dating, but he said what Caleb wanted. He always did.</p>
      <p>“Si. Mamar gallo. Of course, I’m not.”</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>“Is there anyone at the agency you haven’t slept with?” Caleb asked as soon as Cierra
         shut the door, “or in the city limits?”</p>
      <p>James shrugged. “I haven’t poked the blonde ride that moved next door.”</p>
      <p>He meant it as a joke. He caught Caleb spying on her as she unloaded boxes and hadn’t
         let him forget it.</p>
      <p>“She’s not a ride,” Caleb said with more conviction than a girl they hardly knew
         deserved. “I invited her over…to swim.”</p>
      <p>“You’ve talked to her?” There was no shock there. Caleb moved fast. But he hadn’t
         mentioned it and that was unusual. “When?”</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t matter. But I’ve been meaning to tell you, I plan on getting to know her;
         you know, do the girlfriend thing this summer. With a regular girl. One not in the
         scene. Also…I prefer she didn’t know about this.” He motioned to the vanity and rack
         of
         clothes in the otherwise barren loft. His gaze rested on James. “Any of this. When
         girls
         find out about modeling, they treat you differently. You’re in the same boat. Think
         about it.”</p>
      <p>Though it paid well, the sporadic jobs they went on hardly made them models, but James
         shook his head. Thinking was pointless and introspection was something he got plenty
         of,
         during therapy.</p>
      <p>He picked his cigarettes off the table and exchanged the smoke for a blunt. One quick
         hit was all he wanted. “You don’t think this girl will check you out? She knows your
         name. I guarantee she’s already scoped out your Instagram.”</p>
      <p>Caleb eyed the blunt but let it slide. “I edited my bio and removed any incriminating
         pictures. Besides, she lived in the country. In Kansas. How much can she know about
         fashion?”</p>
      <p>“You just called her daft cause she’s not from the city. Fine way to start a
         relationship.” Not that he cared how Cal maintained his girls, as long as they stayed
         out of the way.</p>
      <p>He licked the length of the blunt, the weight in his stomach lighter. If Cal’s issue
         was
         getting to know some random girl before screwing her, he’d wasted two weeks of vacation
         worrying for nothing. Caleb would never put a girl over him. Besides, from the glimpse
         he got of her, half-hidden behind boxes, she wasn’t even hot. As fair as Caleb, she
         resembled one of his many cousins, not a dating prospect.</p>
      <p>He shifted the blunt to the corner of his mouth. “When do I get to meet the girl that
         has you wanting to hide who you are—before you learn who she is?”</p>
      <p>“You’re on a need-to-know basis,” Caleb said, “you have a big mouth. You’d spoil it
         for
         me.”</p>
      <p>“I might.” James lit the blunt and inhaled deep. Smoke filled his lungs and would
         soon
         work its magic on his head. He offered up a hit.</p>
      <p>Caleb waved him off. “I’ll introduce you when she wants me so bad, she doesn’t know
         who
         she is.”</p>
      <p>“You mean when she wants you so bad, there’s no way she’d want me.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever.” Caleb frowned. “So, we’re good? You understand, right? I want a few solid
         weeks of alone time with this girl. Just me and her. Besides, didn’t Dr. Madison say
         you
         needed practice dealing with stuff, solo. Think you can survive summer without me
         keeping you alive?”</p>
      <p>James took another hit then licked his finger and extinguished the heater. In a couple
         days the girl would be forgotten, and he would have his friend back. When it came
         to
         Caleb, solo was not a word in their shared vocabulary.</p>
      <p>He smiled wide, all teeth. “Not a problem. I don’t need you.” </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
