         <h4>Chapter 5</h4>
      </div>
      <p>For the first time since Cassie moved in, Caleb skipped his morning workout. She pulled
         on her robe and headed downstairs. An empty wine bottle sat on the kitchen table.
         Two
         twenties stuck out from underneath, along with a folded paper.</p>
      <p>Flying standby to meet your dad. Be back in a few days. Mom.</p>
      <p>Cassie tossed the note into the garbage, then dialed Caleb. Her call went straight
         to
         voicemail.</p>
      <p>By noon, she had called Caleb five times.</p>
      <p>For supper, she boiled Ramen noodles but couldn’t choke them down. Pacing the kitchen,
         she tried Caleb again. This time she left a message.</p>
      <p>Call me. Please. He’d get back to her now.</p>
      <p>**</p>
      <p>Laughter from the pool reached her bedroom window. Groaning, Cassie rolled over. It
         couldn’t possibly be morning, but daylight said otherwise. At least Caleb was outside.
         Two days minus his swim routine would feel like an alternate universe. She headed
         to the
         window.</p>
      <p>James sat beside the pool eating a banana, while Caleb drifted close by on an inflatable
         lounger. He sipped a drink—like he hadn't a care in the world.</p>
      <p>She snatched her phone from her tangled sheets and dialed his number. She couldn’t
         hear
         his phone ring, but Caleb’s head jerked toward the tiny poolside table. He motioned
         to
         her house, bringing James’ gaze to her window.</p>
      <p>She stepped back, but what the heck? He ignored her call. Screw him—and his crazy
         friend. They could have each other.</p>
      <p>The day dragged. By evening, claps of thunder had her jumping out of her skin and
         lightning split a rainless sky. After checking all the locks, she headed upstairs.</p>
      <p>Though she kept the curtains open, her room seemed extra dark. Last night’s dream
         floated back. She had fallen into a pit and no matter how loud she yelled, no one
         came.
         Despite the humidity, she pulled the sheet to her chin.</p>
      <p>The clock on her dresser glowed twelve-thirty; ten minutes since she last checked.
         Every
         second of solitude seemed like an eternity. She got out of bed. Anything would be
         better
         than lying there.</p>
      <p>Warm light shone from the pool house like a welcoming beacon. What would Caleb do
         if she
         banged on his door and asked why he ignored her? Showing up in her semi-sheer cami
         and
         pajama shorts might loosen his tongue.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The moonless sky made the night blacker than usual. She slipped through the gate into
         Caleb’s backyard and skittered barefoot past the pool, the water dark and bottomless
         in
         the night air. Something rustled under the wisteria vine. A wave of panic sent her
         through the unlocked door without knocking.</p>
      <p>She stopped short. James sat, relaxed against the sofa cushions, bathed in the soft
         light of the muted television. His eyes were closed. Naked, except for white boxer
         briefs, his bare legs sprawled across the coffee table. A guitar rested on the cushion
         beside him, and music emanated from the Bose speaker next to his feet.</p>
      <p>Despite her lack of attire, the air-conditioned room became hot. Fueled by the rush
         of
         being where she shouldn’t, she stepped around the TV. A thick inked band circled James’
         left ankle. Letters twisted up his right thigh. His briefs rode low enough to read
         the
         word Unity, but the picture it curved around remained hidden.</p>
      <p>“And you are?”</p>
      <p>She jerked her head up. His eyes were locked on her, one eyebrow raised. Confusion
         flicked across his features.</p>
      <p>Caleb was right. James had no memory of her.</p>
      <p>“Can you speak?” Both brows were now raised, and a smile played on his lips. He made
         no
         effort to cover up.</p>
      <p>“You’re not dressed,” was all she could come up with.</p>
      <p>“You’re in my bedroom.” He rested his hands on his thighs. “Good thing I didn't fall
         asleep naked with my wank in my hand. Who did you say you were again?”</p>
      <p>“Cassie. I live next door.” She pointed in the direction of her house.</p>
      <p>“Ah.” His jaw tightened; all signs of humor gone. “You must be looking for my brother.
         Funny, he’s never mentioned you.” His gaze flicked to her chest. “But I'm sure he'll
         be
         sorry he missed this.”</p>
      <p>What a liar. James may not remember the other night, but Caleb must have mentioned
         her.
         He looked right at her bedroom window this morning.</p>
      <p>She crossed her arms. “Brother?” She may not know much about his and Caleb’s
         relationship, but she knew they weren’t related.</p>
      <p>He snorted but his dismissive expression wavered. “He didn’t tell you he had a
         brother?”</p>
      <p>She shook her head.</p>
      <p>“It’s late.” He toward the clock. “Cal’s not here so you can go home.”</p>
      <p>Home was the last place she wanted to go, and here was the last place she should be,
         but
         she couldn’t make her feet move. At least in the pool house she wasn’t alone.</p>
      <p>James scratched his chin. “Why did you come here? It's the middle of the night yet
         you
         show up—wearing that.”</p>
      <p>Her reasoning made more sense from her bedroom.</p>
      <p> “Hello?” He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “I’m waiting.”</p>
      <p>“I had a bad dream,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Why isn’t more clothing involved if all you want is comfort?”</p>
      <p>Her cheeks heated, but it was hard to act indignant in her current attire. “Caleb
         hasn't
         been answering my calls. I wanted to talk to him to see why.”</p>
      <p>“And you figure showing up here wearing skimpy pajamas will make it harder for him
         to
         throw you out on your ass.”</p>
      <p>It was exactly what she figured but sounded ridiculous coming out of his mouth.</p>
      <p>James scooped his phone from the coffee table. He turned the music down and relaxed
         against the sofa, arms behind his head. “So…Caleb hasn't talked to you for a couple
         of
         days. I can't imagine why.”</p>
      <p>His smug smile said he knew why—but didn’t plan on telling. Tears filled her eyes.
         They'd probably spent the last two days making fun of her.</p>
      <p>His smile evaporated. He ran his hand through his hair then, with a sigh, retrieved
         a
         pair of jeans from the floor and stepped into them. Leaving them undone, he headed
         to
         the kitchen.</p>
      <p>“I can feel your eyes drilling holes in my back,” he said, as he faced her. “You’re
         making my head throb.”</p>
      <p>“I’m giving you a headache?” He couldn’t be serious.</p>
      <p>“Do you know what the term ‘being eye-fucked’ means, and how it might apply in this
         situation?” He motioned between them.</p>
      <p>Of course, she knew what it meant, but blinked at him, speechless.</p>
      <p>“Forget it.” He shook his head. “Can I interest you in a nice cup of tea?”</p>
      <p>“A nice cup of tea?” There was that accent again. Less evident now that he was sober,
         but still confusing.</p>
      <p>“Holy fuck, angel. Do you parrot Cal like this?”</p>
      <p>He called her, angel.</p>
      <p>James stepped backwards. “Why in the name of our Lord do you keep staring at me? I’m
         a
         fecking boy. Have you not noticed us before? We make up half the planet.”</p>
      <p>“I'm sorry.” She snapped out of her daze. “I'm admiring your tattoos.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t they have ink in Kansas?”</p>
      <p>Ha. He knew where she was from, concrete proof he heard about her. She smiled. “You
         seem
         to know more about me than I know about you.”</p>
      <p>“Wow. It’s capable of conversation.” He rounded the arch into the kitchen.</p>
      <p>She followed, but lingered in the entrance.</p>
      <p>“Okay. You caught me.” He waved a box of tea bags at her. “I know a little bit about
         you. My brother likes to talk about his slappers.”</p>
      <p>From the disgusted twist of his mouth, slapper wasn’t complimentary. He sat the box
         on
         the counter. A tiny leprechaun danced across the front, leaving a trail of clovers.
         Clovers. James was Irish.</p>
      <p>“Your accent…” she trailed off, unsure of a nasty comeback.</p>
      <p>James finished filling a kettle. “Can it finish a sentence?”</p>
      <p>“Are you English?” Not much of an insult, but from his sneer, she hit a nerve.</p>
      <p>“Wrong. Irish.” He slammed a mug on the counter. “I hate being mistaken for
         English.”</p>
      <p>“I hate being mistaken for a…slapper.”</p>
      <p>He studied her a second. “Touché.”</p>
      <p>“I thought all Irishmen had red hair,” she teased, “are you sure you’re Irish?”</p>
      <p>“Allow me to broaden your knowledge. All Irishmen aren’t redsers. But it’s moot in
         my
         case because my real father was from the Ukraine. And, to answer your second, brilliant
         question, since I grew up in Belfast and my last name is Fitzpatrick, I'm pretty sure
         I'm Irish.”</p>
      <p>“You and Caleb aren’t real brothers then,” she pointed out, curious how he would
         answer.</p>
      <p>“Not by blood.” He turned his back to her. A second later, he handed her a sunny yellow
         cup with a string hanging over the side. “Honey?”</p>
      <p>“What?”</p>
      <p>“For your tea.”</p>
      <p>He sat on the sofa and blew into his cup. “It's good. Full of antioxidants.”</p>
      <p>“No thanks.” She sat opposite the sofa and sipped her beverage. “Do you speak Gaelic?
         Or
         Ukrainian?”</p>
      <p>“It's called Irish. Apparently, I think I am fluent when I’ve been drinking. Why do
         you
         ask?”</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you sound like you have an accent, like when you say fuck as feck. Other
         times, you sound normal.”</p>
      <p>“Feck is the politer version. It’s not an accent.” He balanced his mug on his leg.
         “But
         otherwise, I’ve been here for a while. I've assimilated. Thanks for your educated
         thoughts on what’s normal though.”</p>
      <p>Crap, she offended him without trying to. “I like the way you talk. Say something
         in
         Irish.”</p>
      <p>“Tá tú álainn.”</p>
      <p>She blinked, surprised he went along with her request. “What does that mean?”</p>
      <p>“It means, you should go home.”</p>
      <p>She wasn’t sure if he was kidding and didn’t want to leave. When he dropped the sarcasm,
         his banter became fun. “Say purple?”</p>
      <p>“Corcra.”</p>
      <p>“Say dog.”</p>
      <p>He sighed. “Madra.”</p>
      <p>“How do you say, I peed my pants?” How could he not remember an entire night? She
         tried
         not to smile.</p>
      <p>He kept his gaze on hers. “You look dry from here.”</p>
      <p>She blew into her cup.</p>
      <p>“Pissed me' mo trousers. At least that’s how I'd say it. But I advise against doing
         it.
         You’re sitting in Cal's favorite chair.” He set his mug on the table. “So, you want
         to
         know why Cal’s ignoring you?”</p>
      <p>She nodded, mid-sip, eager to find out what she did wrong.</p>
      <p>“He’s just busy.” He narrowed his eyes. “You can drop that puppy dog, ‘I’m so hurt
         my
         boyfriend is ignoring me,’ act. Cal may be gullible, but I recognize a Siren when
         I see
         one.”</p>
      <p>“You think I’m a Siren?” Who even used that word?</p>
      <p>James’ gaze drifted south, to her legs. When he looked up, his eyes were dark. “All
         I’m
         saying is I think you have other motives.”</p>
      <p>“I was too upset to sleep. You still think I’m a man-eater?”</p>
      <p>His expression blanked. “I told you what I thought of you earlier, in Irish.”</p>
      <p>“You wanted me to go home?”</p>
      <p>“I said, I think you are rather beautiful.”</p>
      <p>The word beautiful, sounded exotic coming off his tongue. Damn. Charming. Don’t let
         him
         charm you.</p>
      <p>“Cover yourself.” He placed a cushion in his lap, then tossed her the fuzzy yellow
         blanket from the back of the sofa. “I've got the air cranked.”</p>
      <p>She draped it around her shoulders. “What are we listening to?”</p>
      <p>“Thrash metal. What do you listen to?”</p>
      <p>“Whatever’s on WKSC. You know, Kiss FM.” She named off some hot female singers, thinking
         he would appreciate their sex appeal, but he grimaced.</p>
      <p>“I like Adele, too.” Adele was her favorite vocalist. She waited for his reaction.</p>
      <p>“Those feckin’ Brits can sing.”</p>
      <p>He clicked the music off and reached for the guitar. “You like Zeppelin?”</p>
      <p>“Sure,” she agreed, though not one Zeppelin song came to mind.</p>
      <p>Eyes closed; he played a melancholy tune. After a minute, he stopped and peered at
         her.
         “Do you like it?”</p>
      <p>She nodded. “The music’s sad.”</p>
      <p>“It’s about a woman’s journey for meaning in a world of ambiguity. I can play the
         flute
         parts, too.” He jutted his chin toward the instruments. “The million-dollar question
         is,
         can you name that song?”</p>
      <p>She had no idea what the song was, and after that deep and insightful speech, she
         didn’t
         know who James was, either. Shrugging, she set her empty cup down. “I don’t know the
         title, but you sounded good.”</p>
      <p>He nodded like he heard that a lot. “So, angel, fess up.” After adjusting the music
         to a
         comfortable volume, he reclined, fingers a pyramid in front of his chest. “I’ll be
         your
         therapist. Tell me what you dreamt about.”</p>
      <p>Telling him she had been forgotten in a hole sounded dumb. “I don’t remember,” she
         said.</p>
      <p>He grinned like he could read her mind. “Dreams are just dreams; life, now that’s
         scary.”</p>
      <p>She may be lonely, but outside of Paul, she had never been scared. James turned the
         TV
         off and lit a cigarette. Its burning heater possessed hypnotic qualities in the dark
         room.</p>
      <p>“Does Caleb smoke?” Sometimes he smelled like smoke, but she never saw him with a
         cigarette.</p>
      <p>“Ask him.”</p>
      <p>Her eyes fought to close. “Wow. That tea really works. This is the most relaxed I've
         been all year.” Relaxed was an understatement. She struggled to get the words out.</p>
      <p>Her head bobbed. She jerked upright but couldn't escape the sensation of falling off
         the
         chair. Strong arms encircled her. Lifted her. Pulled her from the pit. She floated
         through space until firmness welcomed her.</p>
      <p>“No bad dreams tonight. I promise,” James’ voice said. She held the hand that belonged
         to the voice and didn't want to let go.</p>
      <p>“Don't leave me,” she imagined saying, squeezing tighter, “keep me safe.”</p>
      <p>The firmness under her shifted, and something warm sided against her. Her fogged brain
         called it a leg. She snuggled against it, enjoying the slight pressure of fingers
         in her
         hair.</p>
      <p>“Talk to me.” she got out, not scared, just relaxed.</p>
      <p>“Shh,” he said. His chest rose and fell under her cheek. “Dún do shúile. Codial go
         sámh
         go séimh.”</p>
      <p>“Doon dul hoola” She tried to commit it to memory. “What’s it mean?”</p>
      <p>“Close your eyes, sleep peacefully, gently. My mother used to sing it to me.”</p>
      <p>“That’s nice.” Something in that visual seemed off, but she fell into quiet darkness
         before she could make sense of her scattered thoughts.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Sunlight woke her. She was in the pool house bedroom, the blanket tucked tightly around
         her like an Egyptian Mummy. Caleb’s voice came from the next room.</p>
      <p>“You gave her what?” He sounded pissed.</p>
      <p>“One of my sleeping pills,” James said, humor evident in his tone. “Just a piece.
         You
         should have seen her, poor thing. Wound up tight.”</p>
      <p>Cassie jumped out of bed. She peered through the gap in the door.</p>
      <p>Caleb paced into, then out of, her view. “Why didn't you call me?”</p>
      <p>“Because you suck at being a boyfriend. It’s your fault she hasn't been sleeping.
         You’ve
         been ignoring her.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve been busy.” Caleb plopped onto a chair in her line of vision. “Busy with you.”</p>
      <p>“I told her that.” James’ said, his voice farther away. “She shows up while I'm asleep,
         wearing just my feckin cacks. I open my eyes and there she is. How am I supposed to
         know
         what you’d want me to do with her?”</p>
      <p>Caleb pinched the bridge of his nose. “I think it’s safe to assume I wouldn't want
         you
         drugging her and carrying her off to bed.”</p>
      <p>James drugged her? Drugged her—and tucked her in. Dún do shúile, His words came back.
         Close your eyes. Sleep peacefully.</p>
      <p>“It was just a little drugging.” James paused. “Okay, I'm sorry I drugged your
         girlfriend. I won't do it again.”</p>
      <p>“I didn't realize you had pills left.” Caleb’s voice became all business. “I want
         them.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever.” A container bounced off Caleb’s knee. “I don’t need them.”</p>
      <p>Caleb retrieved the bottle and sat back down.</p>
      <p>“Happy?” James asked, his back to the bedroom. “Hey, think I’m healed enough to go
         into
         the house? I stashed some cash under your mattress.”</p>
      <p>“You look better,” Caleb said, “but mom will still have a heart attack if she sees
         you.”</p>
      <p>Cassie crossed her legs. As illuminating as their conversation was, she had to pee.
         A
         daylight assessment of her attire produced a groan. Her top was more transparent than
         she thought. Her brain must have been sleep-deprived last night.</p>
      <p>She pulled on a discarded t-shirt and jerked the bedroom door open. They both turned
         to
         look at her. A disheveled James, still shirtless and in track pants, hovered by the
         front door.</p>
      <p>She glared at him. “You drugged my tea?”</p>
      <p>He had the decency to blush.</p>
      <p>“What else did you do to me?” She should be angrier, but at no point had she felt
         threatened, and she did have a great sleep.</p>
      <p>He grabbed the doorknob. “Don't flatter yourself.” </p>
      <p>Caleb narrowed his eyes, like he was mad at her comment. His jaw relaxed, and he stood.
         “James, apologize to her.”</p>
      <p>James opened the door. He stepped forward, then stopped, his shoulders sagging. He
         stepped back into the room and slammed the door.</p>
      <p>“Jesus.” He glowered at Caleb. “I’m sorry I drugged your tea, Cassandra. I’m a bad,
         bad
         boy.” He curtsied.</p>
      <p>“For fuck’s sake,” Caleb muttered, lowering his head into his hands.</p>
      <p>Cassie glanced from one to the other. Shaking her head, she proceeded into the bathroom.
         When she came out, James was gone. She sat on the sofa and waited for Caleb to say
         something.</p>
      <p>He smiled. “I’m sorry I didn't call. I've been preoccupied.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I get that now.” She didn't have the stamina to be angry. Her brain felt like
         a
         cement ball.</p>
      <p>“And I’m sorry my friend drugged you. Words I never thought I’d say.”</p>
      <p>“Apologizing for James must be a full-time job.” She sighed. “I shouldn’t have
         insinuated your friend is a pervert.”</p>
      <p>Caleb grew somber. “I know he didn't touch you. He wouldn't do that.”</p>
      <p>“Would he date rape someone you weren't seeing?”</p>
      <p>“Of course not. But I told you, his parents messed him up. I believe in his own way,
         he
         wanted to help you. James is a lot of things, but he isn't dangerous.” Caleb pulled
         his
         eyebrows together. “He would never hurt someone defenseless…” Groaning, he shook his
         head in defeat. “Why are you wearing his shirt?”</p>
      <p>“I grabbed it off the floor. To cover this.”</p>
      <p>She lifted the shirt, exposing her gauzy top. His wide eyes rewarded her effort. She
         may
         be invisible to James, but she effected Caleb.</p>
      <p>“What were you thinking, coming here in the middle of the night? Wearing that.”</p>
      <p>“I was thinking I missed you.”</p>
      <p>His expression softened. He pulled her into his lap and placed a soft kiss on her
         lips.
         “What did you guys do?”</p>
      <p>“Are you jealous?”</p>
      <p>“Curious.”</p>
      <p>“Curious about me? Or James?” After the last few days, she assumed the latter. “He
         made
         me tea, as you established, and played me a song.”</p>
      <p>“He played you a song?” His voice tightened. “What song?”</p>
      <p>She shrugged. “I didn’t recognize it.</p>
      <p>“What did he play it on?”</p>
      <p>She pointed to the guitar that rested against the sofa. “It sounded really good.”</p>
      <p>Caleb expelled a deep breath. “James is really talented when it comes to music.”</p>
      <p>“Among other things.” James let the door slam behind him. He scanned her then flopped
         onto the sofa, lips twisted in disgust. “You might want to put some bottoms on.”</p>
      <p>No longer comfortable, she moved to get up, but Caleb wrapped his arms about her.
         “How’d
         it go in the house?”</p>
      <p>“Not good.” James reached for the remote. “Mom freaked. I told her I fell, which is
         the
         fecking truth for once, and she thinks I'm lying. Maybe you should go see her. She
         tried
         to check out the damage and I backed away. Go let her hug on you or something. Tell
         her
         I'm sorry.”</p>
      <p>Caleb leaned past Cassie. “Don't feel bad. She understands.”</p>
      <p>Whatever they were talking about didn't sound like any of her business. And for once,
         her inquisitive nature had been quelled. Her head hurt enough without trying to decode
         their bromance.</p>
      <p>She pried Caleb’s arms loose. “I need to go. I’m meeting Allison to work on an
         assignment.”</p>
      <p>“Wait.” James tossed the remote onto the cushion. He rummaged through the basket of
         folded laundry next to the sofa, then threw her a pair of joggers. “You can't leave
         wearing just your drawers.”</p>
      <p>“Drawers?” she questioned as she slipped the track pants on.</p>
      <p>Caleb raised his shoulders in an uninterested half shrug. “When his words make no
         sense,
         nod and pretend you get what he’s talking about. By the way. Was he right? Cassie
         stands
         for Cassandra.”</p>
      <p>She hated to admit James guessed correctly but nodded. Though the conversation was
         about
         him, James flipped through the stations, seemingly uninterested.</p>
      <p>“Pretty,” Caleb said, “I like it.” He leaned in to kiss her.</p>
      <p>James looked up from the TV, an unlit cigarette between his lips. He caught her gaze
         and
         raised an eyebrow.</p>
      <p>Closing her eyes, she concentrated on moving her lips.</p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
