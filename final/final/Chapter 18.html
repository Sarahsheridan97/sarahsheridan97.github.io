      <p>“Are you going to tell me what really happened last night?” James asked as soon as
         she
         re-entered the room.</p>
      <p>Cassie sank into the chair. “You heard what I told your doctor.”</p>
      <p>“I'm assuming you left some details out.”</p>
      <p>“Some,” she admitted.</p>
      <p>“I know I got shanked in an alley, and I know why. What I need you to tell me is what
         happened before—and after.”</p>
      <p>She frowned. “Did you know that guy?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I knew him. But you don't, and neither does Caleb, so it's not important.”</p>
      <p>“Is he crazy? What made him stab you?”</p>
      <p>“Let it go.” James’ voice stayed even. “Just tell me what you saw. We were shooting
         pool, right?”</p>
      <p>“You had a flask of something. You kept filling Caleb’s cup—and he kept drinking.”
         James
         paled and she paused. Inflicting guilt wasn’t her intention.</p>
      <p>“Go on,” he encouraged, “give me the facts.”</p>
      <p>“Caleb insisted you snuck out the side door, so after a few minutes we followed.”
         It was
         a descriptive timeline, and where she wished to stop.</p>
      <p>“What did you guys see?”</p>
      <p>“You were kneeling on the ground, over that guy. You tried to stand up…but stumbled
         backward. Your clothes were bloody… a knife stuck out of you.”</p>
      <p>“That’s all?” He watched her closely.</p>
      <p>“You passed out. Went into shock or something.”</p>
      <p>“Nothing else?”</p>
      <p>She frowned. What else was there? “I think Caleb went temporarily insane. One minute
         he
         stood beside me, the next he attacked that guy. Ron had to pull him off.”</p>
      <p>“Where were you during all this?”</p>
      <p>“With you. I held your hand until help arrived.” She leaned back in the chair.</p>
      <p>“You held my hand?” His voice tightened.</p>
      <p>“Well, Ron took off, and Caleb was crying—”</p>
      <p>“Shite. Cal was crying?”</p>
      <p>“He thought you were dead, James. You know how he gets when someone messes with you.
         He
         wanted to kill that guy. I'm not kidding. The police had him on the ground in
         handcuffs.”</p>
      <p>“No way.” He stared past her.</p>
      <p>“When the paramedics strapped you down, Caleb freaked out all over again, begging
         them
         to unbuckle you.”</p>
      <p>“They took Cal away,” James’ voice was dark, “shackled.”</p>
      <p>“I don't know what happened after that. I left with you.”</p>
      <p>“You rode with me?” His eyes snapped to her. “Shotgun, right?”</p>
      <p>“They let me sit in the back.”</p>
      <p>“You’re spoofing me? They never let people in the back.”</p>
      <p>She sighed. “You really can’t remember any of this?”</p>
      <p>He shook his head.</p>
      <p>“Do you remember waking up last night and talking to me?”</p>
      <p>He shot her a tortured look. “Sorry if I was more of an ass to you than normal.”
         Reclining the bed, he closed his eyes. “I need some time—alone—to process this. Can
         you
         disappear for a bit?”</p>
      <p>Disappear? What did that mean? She glared at him.</p>
      <p>He opened his eyes. “Mellow out. You can come back. Just give me an hour. Go get some
         air or something.”</p>
      <p>She jerked herself out of the chair. Who did he think he was? Come, go, sit, stay.
         Was
         she a puppy? She headed for the door.</p>
      <p>“Hey.”</p>
      <p>She stopped. Crap. She was a puppy.</p>
      <p>“Come back here for a minute.”</p>
      <p>She stomped toward him. He could have his say, then she would give him a piece of
         her
         mind.</p>
      <p>James examined his nails. When he lifted his head, he was no longer scowling. Instead,
         he gave her a bashful smile, catching her more off guard than cursing her out ever
         could.</p>
      <p>He reached for her hand. “I'm not used to saying this to girls, but I want you to
         stay.
         Just let me sleep for a bit without feeling like I'm being watched.” He brought her
         hand
         to his lips. “For the record, I've never kissed a girl’s hand, either.”</p>
      <p>Heat shot up her arm and exploded in her stomach. She jerked her hand away.</p>
      <p>He laughed, then winced. “You should see your expression. Good thing I didn't kiss
         your
         cheek.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever.” She backed away until her fingers touched the door frame. “I’m going home
         for a bit. Keep your lips to yourself or I won't come back.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>Despite it being late afternoon, Cassie’s mother lay asleep on the sofa. Cassie crept
         up
         the stairs to her room, then dumped the contents of her backpack onto her bed. She
         proceeded to the pool house with the empty sac. To her relief she found the pool house
         door, unlocked.</p>
      <p>What might James need? She stuffed a pair of jeans, a couple of T-shirts, and some
         underwear—all waistbands she had memorized—into her backpack, along with a new
         toothbrush. Confused by the bottles of aftershave and deodorant, she grabbed the only
         one in a plastic container.</p>
      <p>She left his cigarettes on the table and called a taxi.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James was still asleep when she returned. The drapes were drawn, and supper waited
         on
         the bedside table.</p>
      <p>The older nurse stuck her head in. “His room is ready,” she informed Cassie, “We’ll
         get
         everything unhooked so he can ride in a chair for the transition.”</p>
      <p>“Right now?” He wasn’t going to like this.</p>
      <p>The nurse shook her head. “I'll pop back in. It's probably better if you don't mention
         this. I think it will go easier if he doesn’t have time to stress about it.”</p>
      <p>Cassie rolled her eyes. “Why does everyone tiptoe around him?”</p>
      <p>The nurse checked her watch. “It’s been a long day. It’ll be easier on both of us
         if he
         is cooperative, and I've heard that isn’t one of his finer points.”</p>
      <p>Cassie curled back into the chair. The nurse wasn't being fair. Cooperation may not
         have
         been one of James’ better traits, but he was loyal to Caleb to a fault, had this amazing
         way of seeing through people, and wasn't scared to tell the truth. Plus, she trusted
         him. They were solid traits. Appealing ones.</p>
      <p>“Cal!” James bolted upright, his eyes wild. He covered his stitches. “Damn.”</p>
      <p>“Caleb’s not here.” Cassie hovered over him and his features relaxed. “Are you
         okay?”</p>
      <p>“You came back. Did I yell out loud?”</p>
      <p>He allowed her to ease him back into a reclined position. “You yelled for Caleb,
         again.”</p>
      <p>“Again?”</p>
      <p>Cassie nodded, but chose not to tell him how many times he cried out for Caleb, or
         that
         he called for his mam. Regardless of whom he wanted, hearing him beg, hurt.</p>
      <p>His gaze swept sleepily over his supper tray. “What time is it, anyway?”</p>
      <p>“Late afternoon.” She removed the lid from the plate to expose another bland meal.
         “By
         the way, a nurse stopped by. She wants to remove the tubes so you can go to your new
         room.”</p>
      <p>He immediately appeared more alert.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t supposed to tell you. She thought it would be easier if you didn’t have
         time
         to stress about it. But you're a big boy. I know you can handle a simple medical
         procedure.”</p>
      <p>She may not be a psychiatrist but figured if she expected him to be strong, he would
         be.
         Pride would overrule his fear.</p>
      <p>His jaw twitched. “You think you know a lot about me.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe I do.” The last twenty hours had been a crash course. “You don’t want to be
         messed with and freak out when anyone comes too close.” He glared at her, but she
         continued, “The best way to get left alone in the hospital is to allow people do their
         job.”</p>
      <p>His mouth twisted, but he remained silent. Either she was right, or he didn't have
         the
         stamina to argue with her.</p>
      <p>Both worked.</p>
      <p>As promised, the nurse returned within the hour. She wheeled a cart bearing medical
         supplies and stopped at the foot of James bed. He made a strangled sound that ended
         in a
         cough.</p>
      <p>She frowned at Cassie. “You told him.”</p>
      <p>Unable to deny the obvious, Cassie shrugged.</p>
      <p>With a sigh, the nurse removed a small metal basin from the cart. She addressed James.
         “I’m going to remove your catheter and IV. Neither are difficult procedures—if you
         cooperate. You can request a male nurse, but you will have to wait.”</p>
      <p>James’ shook his head. “Take the effing thing out now.”</p>
      <p>The nurse turned to Cassie. “This will only take a minute. Can you step into the hall,
         please?”</p>
      <p>“No,” James said as Cassie got up to leave, his panic unmistakable, “stay here.”</p>
      <p>“You want me to stay?” She stammered the words and would rather leave, but he appeared
         terrified.</p>
      <p>He chewed his bottom lip, then nodded. “Turn your chair to face me.”</p>
      <p>The nurse washed her hands and slipped on a pair of blue gloves. She didn’t seem to
         care
         who was in the room. “You’ll feel my hand and some tugging,” she said, once Cassie
         got
         situated.</p>
      <p>James paled. How could someone who got into so many fights, fear a simple medical
         procedure? Cassie planted her elbows on the bed and leaned forward. James’ had the
         longest lashes.</p>
      <p>He caught her eyes. A tiny smirk ghosted his lips. She kept his gaze and tried not
         to
         think about what was happening.</p>
      <p>“Shite.” James glanced around her. His eyebrows raised, then knotted. “She could at
         least be hot.”</p>
      <p>Cassie held her breath. If she were the nurse, she would rip out that tube extra
         fast.</p>
      <p>“I was hot once, if that helps.” The nurse didn’t sound upset. “Use your
         imagination.”</p>
      <p>James shifted in obvious discomfort.</p>
      <p>Cassie chuckled. “You’re blushing.”</p>
      <p>“All done.” The nurse moved away from the bed. “Didn’t spill a drop.”</p>
      <p>“Christ,” James mumbled, the pink in his cheeks darker.</p>
      <p>Cassie looked behind her. The blankets were heaped over his groin, his legs bare.
         Her
         cheeks heated to match his.</p>
      <p>The nurse dumped everything into a bag. She peeled her gloves off and tucked the blanket
         in. “Now the IV.”</p>
      <p>A few seconds later, he was free of all the equipment.</p>
      <p>He rubbed the puncture mark. “That hurt.”</p>
      <p>“Really?” Relieved it was over, Cassie smiled. “That's the first time I've heard you
         say
         ouch, and I know of a few occasions when you should have.”</p>
      <p>“Was I drunk?”</p>
      <p>The smile died on her lips. She’d already seen him demolish himself more than she
         wanted
         to—in a lifetime. How did Caleb cope?</p>
      <p>“Speaking of being drunk. Are you still experiencing withdrawal symptoms?” The nurse
         waited for a reply.</p>
      <p>He shot Cassie a sideways glance. “None of your fecken business. You’re not my
         doctor.”</p>
      <p>“No, I am not.” The nurse let out a heavy sigh. “But I pity him.”</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
