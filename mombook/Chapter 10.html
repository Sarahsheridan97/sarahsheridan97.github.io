      <p>Caleb didn’t need the orchestra of drummers pounding in his head to tell him it had
         been
         stupid to drink two nights in a row. But Cassie had been busy, so when James showed
         up
         with Alexa, a bottle of Absinthe and some underfed, model wannabe he figured, what
         the
         hell.</p>
      <p>He struggled off the sofa and stumbled over Ronnie, entombed in a blanket, on floor.
         At
         least the dude wasn't in a puddle of vomit. A definite plus.</p>
      <p>A lone bottle of orange juice sat on the top shelf of the pool house fridge. Caleb
         swallowed two Motrin from his Ziplocked emergency stash, then lit the wrong end of
         a
         cigarette. According to his reflection in the toaster, this summer might just kill
         him.</p>
      <p>Ronnie shuffled into the kitchen. He stopped under the arch to massage his temples.
         “Shit, Caleb. I hope I look better than you.”</p>
      <p>“I doubt it.” Caleb tossed him the Motrin then slumped into a chair alongside the
         table.
         “Did those girls leave? Tell me they did.”</p>
      <p>“They’re gone.” Ron swallowed two of the pills waterless. He examined the last pill
         through the clear, plastic bag. “You sure this isn’t James' medication?”</p>
      <p>“Those are in prescription bottles.” Caleb glanced at the closed bedroom door. The
         last
         thing he needed was for James to overhear them discussing his meds. “My mom won't
         let
         him keep his medication back here, which is a good thing. I think Alexa’s friend would
         have stolen them.”</p>
      <p>“Speaking of Alexa’s friends.” Ronnie threw him the bag. “Where was Cassie last night?
         I
         expected you’d be busy with her—since your balls are in her purse.”</p>
      <p>“That’s a stupid euphemism.” Caleb took another drink and debated whether to answer.
         “Her parents got back yesterday. Her dad took her to dinner.”</p>
      <p>“Cool.” Ron grinned. “So…did you screw Veronica?”</p>
      <p>Despite his headache, Caleb laughed. “I wouldn't touch that girl with a barge pole.”
         It
         was one of James’ crazy expressions. “I don't need the clap.”</p>
      <p>“What the fuck is that?”</p>
      <p>“Some STD. My mom gave us the 'cover your junk or you'll get the clap' lecture as
         soon
         as I turned fourteen. It was too late for James, though. She missed him by a few days.
         For weeks he was terrified his dick would fall off, but her tactic worked.” The memory
         made him smile. “He always 'covers' now.”</p>
      <p>“Enough.” Ron headed for the door; his face puckered in disgust. “You guys know way
         too
         much about each other.”</p>
      <p>“You don’t get it because you have sisters.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever, dude,” Ron said from the doorway. “See you on Friday. Remember, pool at
         Smitty’s. And open the window, it smells awful in here.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Caleb took another haul on the cigarette, but it only made him feel worse. Ron was
         right, fresh air would be good. He got to the kitchen window just as Cassie cornered
         the
         garage.</p>
      <p>“Shit.” He tossed the cigarette in half a glass of stale water.</p>
      <p>Instead of letting herself in, Cassie knocked.</p>
      <p>Juice in hand, Caleb made his way around Ron’s makeshift bed, to the door. He offered
         Cassie a wide smile but failed to move out of her way.</p>
      <p>She peered around him. “Can I come in?”</p>
      <p>“Sure. Sorry.” He stepped aside.</p>
      <p>She stopped in the middle of the living room her expression tight. “What did you guys
         do
         last night?” A tiny, uncertain laugh punctuated her question.</p>
      <p>“I… ah…” His eyes skirted the room, trying to see what she saw; stacked pizza boxes,
         filled ashtrays, and tipped over cups. It didn’t look good, and the truth sounded
         worse.
         He set the spilled sugar bowl on the coffee table beside the Absinthe and stared at
         the
         heap of sugar on the carpet. He failed to consider her response to an obvious party
         without her. She didn’t look impressed.</p>
      <p>The bedroom door opened, and James staggered out. He pulled jeans on but left them
         undone. Gripping the waistband, he scowled at Cassie as he cruised by, en-route to
         the
         bathroom.</p>
      <p>“What's his problem?” She gazed toward the closed bathroom door for a few beats then
         dropped onto the sofa.</p>
      <p>Caleb shrugged. “Who knows.” Anything could be wrong, or nothing could be wrong. James
         was such an ass when Cassie was around.</p>
      <p>Her unimpressed expression became angry. She looked at him.</p>
      <p>“I can make something up,” he offered.</p>
      <p>The bathroom door opened, and James slumped into the nearest chair. “It's a
         colloquialism.”</p>
      <p>“Huh?” Caleb asked as he plopped onto the far end of the sofa.</p>
      <p>“The balls in her purse thing. It's a colloquialism, not a euphemism. And yes, my
         junk
         is always covered, mostly thanks to your paranoia. Although, you were right, Mom’s
         lecture scared the crap out of me.”</p>
      <p>Caleb chuckled. “How long have you been awake?”</p>
      <p>“Was I supposed to be sleeping?” A couple of pills lay in James’ open hand. He popped
         them into his mouth before Caleb could tell what they were. “They’re Advil, Cal,”
         James
         said as he reached for the juice, “relax.</p>
      <p>After a long drink, he set the container on top of the stack of pizza boxes. “You
         must
         be here to return the testicles.” The question was obviously meant for Cassie, though
         James stared off in the other direction.</p>
      <p>Cassie stuttered out a reply, but James cut her off. “That was a rhetorical statement
         since we are using our SAT words this morning.”</p>
      <p>“Jovial as ever?” Cassie said, just as Caleb was about to warn James to watch it.
         She
         also looked in the other direction.</p>
      <p>James' gaze swung to her. “That's not an uncommon word.” He appeared amused although
         his
         tone was derisive.</p>
      <p>“Don’t be an ass.” Caleb shook his head.</p>
      <p>“You could call him a wisenheimer,” Cassie suggested, raising James’ brows.</p>
      <p>Caleb rolled his eyes. “Please don't encourage him.”</p>
      <p>“Encourage who?” Alexa stepped out of the bedroom; her bare legs stuck out from under
         her blanket.</p>
      <p>Caleb started. “You're still here.” Cassie’s eyes had bugged out. He should have
         mentioned the girls, immediately.</p>
      <p>Alexa perched on the arm of James’ chair and smiled. “James insisted I spend the night.”
         She tried to tousle his hair, but he ducked out of her reach.</p>
      <p>“Friends don't let friends drive drunk,” he said.</p>
      <p>“She’s not drunk now,” Caleb pointed out. Cassie had stood up, her face an angry shade
         of red. When Alexa didn’t budge, he leaned forward. “You need to move your car before
         our mom comes out to see who's here.”</p>
      <p>His mother wouldn't check, but he would get the tenth degree about who spent the
         night.</p>
      <p>“I was hoping to take a shower,” Alexa said, her hand on James' shoulder, “join me?”</p>
      <p>“Pass.” There was no bite to his voice, but no interest, either. “Cal's right. You
         should go.”</p>
      <p>She snatched her hand back and jumped up. “Fuck you, James.” She stormed past them
         and
         slammed the bedroom door.</p>
      <p>The thud echoed through Caleb’s head. He helped himself to the last Motrin.</p>
      <p>Cassie cleared her throat and sat back down. “Does all your special time with that
         girl
         end so dramatically? That's the second time she’s said, fuck you, James, instead of
         goodbye.”</p>
      <p>“Second time?” Caleb checked James for clarification but only received a shrug.</p>
      <p>A minute later, Alexa emerged. She headed out the door without another word.</p>
      <p>Cassie looked toward the bedroom. “Anyone else in there?”</p>
      <p>“Nope.” James stood and stretched his arms behind his head. “Only one girl in my bed
         last night.”</p>
      <p>“That’s… interesting.” A better word wouldn’t come to Caleb’s mind. “You shared a
         bed
         with Alexa?”</p>
      <p>Disgust spread across James’ face. “We shared a lot of stuff, but a bed wasn't one
         of
         them. I contemplated my evening’s mistakes on the floor.”</p>
      <p>Caleb chuckled. “If you feel that way, why do you keep hooking up?” He glanced at
         Cassie, unsure how the conversation sat with her. Her expression read pissed, as if
         he
         slept with a girl.</p>
      <p>“How detailed do you want the explanation?” James paused in front of the bathroom
         door.
         “I need to brush my teeth.”</p>
      <p>“Never mind,” Caleb said. He shouldn’t have asked. Anything that came out of James'
         mouth would only make things worse.</p>
      <p>Cassie crossed her arms—then her legs. Hoping to appease her, Caleb smiled. “I’ll
         shower
         in here today. Wait for me.”</p>
      <p>“Okay.” She gave him a tiny, unenthusiastic nod. “It's not like I have anywhere else
         to
         go.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Caleb knocked on the bathroom door. Permission to enter granted, he stepped inside.
         James looked up from the sink. “Hiding from your girlfriend?”</p>
      <p>“You’re not funny.” Caleb sat on the closed toilet seat. “Shower in the house today?
         And
         don’t say anything rude to Cassie on your way out. She's mad enough.”</p>
      <p>James dropped his toothbrush into the cup. “I wasn’t planning on being rude. You need
         to
         mellow out. Seriously. Do you like her that much?”</p>
      <p>Cassie was okay, but she was weirdly madder than she should be, and he didn’t like
         feeling he did something wrong because he hung with other girls. “I do,” he said,
         “What
         is wrong with everyone today?”</p>
      <p>James stared at him for a second then shook his head. He slipped through the door
         into
         the living room. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
