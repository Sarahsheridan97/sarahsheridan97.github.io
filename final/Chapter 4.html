      <p>Caleb curled around Cassie on the pool house sofa; his chin nuzzled against the top
         of
         her head. The shopping trip went off without a hitch. They ate supper out, then settled
         down to watch TV Land’s Fantasy Island marathon. It may not have been exciting, but
         with
         short notice, it was the best he could do. Besides, Cassie had never seen the show,
         or
         any of the retro series he loved.</p>
      <p>The shrill ring from the cordless phone on the end table jarred Caleb from his TV
         coma.
         He stretched to answer it, expecting his mother who used the landline like an
         intercom.</p>
      <p>James’ number lit the screen instead.</p>
      <p>He scrambled over Cassie. Since he didn’t want his first words to be, “Where the hell
         are you?” he took a relaxing breath. “What’s up?”</p>
      <p>“Is this Cal?” The voice on the other end was unsure, and female.</p>
      <p>Not used to strangers calling him Cal, or girls on the other end of James’ line, he
         paused.</p>
      <p>“James told me to call you if needed,” the girl said, “but your other number went
         right
         to voicemail.”</p>
      <p>Damn. To appease Cassie, he hadn’t touched his phone all evening. He glanced at her,
         still absorbed in Fantasy Island, unaware the quiet evening just blew up.</p>
      <p>“Who are you?” he asked, stepping away from the sofa.</p>
      <p>“I'm his sitter.”</p>
      <p>“Sitter?” Caleb wet his lips. “Where’s James? Why didn’t he call me himself?”</p>
      <p>The girl huffed, “Never mind. You're freaking. I’ll take care of it myself.”</p>
      <p>“No... I'm not freaking out.” He tightened his grip on the slick plastic receiver.
         “I'm
         trying to figure out what's going on.”</p>
      <p>“Who is that?” Cassie mouthed.</p>
      <p>He motioned to give him a moment, then cranked the volume on the TV. He stalked into
         the
         kitchen. “Is James okay?”</p>
      <p>“I think so.” The girl sounded unsure. “He's breathing, but he hit his head. I’d let
         him
         lie there, but my boyfriend called. He’s on his way home and James has to be gone.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t a good visual. He wanted to reach through the phone and shake her. “Where
         are
         you?”</p>
      <p>“5950 South Wells. It's in Fuller Park. The quickest way is to drop down to 47th.”</p>
      <p>Caleb yanked his cell from his pocket. “Typing the address in now.” The map showed
         him
         the same way. “You know where I live?”</p>
      <p>“Just hurry up.”</p>
      <p>“I will.” He headed to the sofa. “Give me ten minutes.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“I have to go,” he said as he slipped into his shoes. Cassie gaped at him, but he
         had no
         intention of offering an explanation. He circled the room. “Where are my damn keys?”</p>
      <p>“Calm down.” She located the keys from beside the TV then pressed them into his palm.
         “Is everything okay?”</p>
      <p>Nothing was okay. He should never have brushed James off. His mother would kill him
         if
         something bad happened—and he would never forgive himself.</p>
      <p>He headed for the door. “I need to go help a friend.”</p>
      <p>“I got that. Can I come?”</p>
      <p>“Nope.” Images of getting shot at by some gang banger floated through his head. It
         would
         be impossible to watch out for her and James at the same time. “It might get dicey.
         You
         should go home.”</p>
      <p>“Sounds intriguing.” She snatched her purse and followed him across the grass, to
         the
         garage. “You might need me. I'll be good.” She crossed her fingers over her heart.</p>
      <p>Dragging her into a James situation would irrevocably change the solitude he’d been
         enjoying. But her eyes were bright. She seemed excited by the possibility of danger.
         Their earlier conversation floated back to him. She craved excitement while he wanted
         peace. It was like they were on two different tracks heading in opposite directions.</p>
      <p>She opened the passenger door and smiled over the car. “Come on, Caleb. Let me help
         you.”</p>
      <p>“Get in,” he said. There was no time to waste.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>“Is it possible to get anywhere in Chicago in ten minutes?” Cassie asked over the
         bass
         line pounding from his car speakers. She clung to the door as they squealed around
         the
         first corner, but he had no intention of slowing down. “Whose car is this? It looks
         like
         the one on Dukes of Hazzard.”</p>
      <p>“I'm impressed.” He flashed her a wide smile, happy for the distraction. “It’s
         mine.”</p>
      <p>“You own a car? Why do we walk so much?”</p>
      <p>“Walking's the best way to learn a city.” He turned the radio down. “I might need
         you to
         drive James’ car home. It’s a stick.”</p>
      <p>“I can drive a stick,” she said, proudly, “I’ve driven the tractor on my grandpa’s
         farm.
         Told you I’d be helpful.”</p>
      <p>“Look, Cassie.” What did he want to convey? “You seem excited by all this and James
         is
         my best friend—but he's messed up.”</p>
      <p>“Messed up how?”</p>
      <p>No longer able to avoid the topic, he sighed. “Without getting into it, his parents
         were
         wackjobs. He got a ton of cash from them, along with a scrambled head. He lived with
         us
         because the state placed him there.”</p>
      <p>“That’s how you met?”</p>
      <p>“We met at the University of Chicago. We were part of this long-term study my mom
         helped
         run.” He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. “We learned musical selections
         followed by several types of math tests. I’ve known James since I was six. Take it
         from
         me, he’s all over the place—and can find trouble.</p>
      <p>“Wow.” Cassie stared at him.</p>
      <p>It was an impressed sounding wow, the opposite of what he wanted.</p>
      <p>“Wow, what?” He clicked the radio off and waited.</p>
      <p>“You guys must be smart—and James sounds intriguing.”</p>
      <p>Intriguing? He gave her a sideways look, trying to get a handle on her expression.
         “There is nothing Intriguing or even interesting about him. Keep your distance,
         okay?”</p>
      <p>“Okay.” She chuckled.</p>
      <p>“Seriously.” Caleb poked her shoulder. “He's unpredictable—and charming. It's a deadly
         combination.”</p>
      <p>She poked him back. “It sounds like you're scared I'll run away with him. Did he steal
         one of your many girlfriends?”</p>
      <p>That was the funniest thing she’d said. “Believe me, he doesn’t need my girls.”</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Cassie released a relieved sigh when they rounded the corner onto Wells. They made
         it in
         under fifteen minutes.</p>
      <p>“What was the address?” she asked, not that it mattered. Not all the buildings had
         numbers—or windows. They passed one without a front door.</p>
      <p>“5950.” Caleb slowed the Charger. “There it is.”</p>
      <p>He parked in front of a vintage, black Mustang that blended into the night. If that
         was
         James’ car, the ride back would be fun.</p>
      <p>A squat, one-story brick building sat back from the curb, a blanket draped its front
         window. This is how she imagined the South Side. This was exciting.</p>
      <p>Caleb banged on the solid, metal door. She peeked over his shoulder as the door inched
         open.</p>
      <p>A skinny young woman appeared in the gap. She pushed stringy black bangs away from
         her
         eyes and gave them a scrutinizing once over. “Are you Cal?”</p>
      <p>“Caleb,” he corrected, his shoulder against the door, like he planned to barrel through
         if needed. “Where’s James? And who are you?”</p>
      <p>“He’s still out of it.” She moved to let them pass into a messy, living room. “I told
         you, I’m his sitter. You can call me T. That’s all you need to know.”</p>
      <p>“I don't get it,” Cassie whispered when the girl turned to secure three huge locks,
         “who
         is she?”</p>
      <p>Caleb shifted his gaze to the floor. “A sitter watches you when you get high to make
         sure you don't hurt yourself.”</p>
      <p>“She didn't do a very good job,” Cassie said loud enough for T to hear.</p>
      <p>“He’s in the bedroom,” the girl said as she passed them. Her gaze brushed over Cassie,
         “Something freaked him out; he jumped off the sofa and took off running. Just get
         him
         and go.”</p>
      <p>The back room contained no bed—or anything that made it worthy of the title, bedroom,
         and smelled like a bathroom. Cassie stopped in the middle of the scattered cardboard
         boxes and discarded piles of clothes and waited for her eyes to adjust to the low
         watt
         bulb dangling from the ceiling. It took a few seconds to locate James, face down on
         the
         cracked linoleum.</p>
      <p>“Damn it.” Caleb rushed forward. “Is there another light in here?”</p>
      <p>T fumbled with a floor lamp and all three of its arms clicked on. She adjusted one
         of
         the arms and a bright circle of light crept across the floor, illuminating the
         situation.</p>
      <p>So, this was the mystical James. The streaker. His unbuttoned shirt fanned out on
         either
         side of him, the tips of his dark hair tucked under the collar. One of the sleeves
         was
         cuffed and his tattooed forearm twisted at an uncomfortable angle from his body. Blood
         splattered the dirty white paint of the open closet door.</p>
      <p>More curious than scared, Cassie inched forward. She sidestepped a pool of liquid
         and
         knelt as Caleb carefully rolled James over.</p>
      <p>James’ bangs, the ends matted, tumbled off his face. A gash across his forehead had
         bled
         out and gaped open. His top lip was split and swollen. The front of his jeans, soaked
         with urine, explained the puddle on the floor and the smell in the room.</p>
      <p>Caleb drew a long breath, his face white. “Jesus.”</p>
      <p>Cassie also took a breath. James’ long lashes curled in an enviable manor, his cheek
         bones prominent, his jaw strong. Even in his current state, James was beautiful. And
         like a broken china doll, his ruin pulled at her heart in the same manner. It seemed
         intrusive to witness such vulnerability in a stranger. She looked across to Caleb.</p>
      <p>His eyes flicked to her, as if to catch her reaction, then he lit into T. “What the
         fuck
         did he take?”</p>
      <p>“Magic mint,” T said from the shadows outside the ring of light. “At least that's
         all I
         know about. He was boozed up when he got here.”</p>
      <p>“He drove here? Drunk?” The muscle in Caleb’s jaw flexed.</p>
      <p>T nodded. “He brought a bag of the stuff and insisted on trying it. He asked if I
         would
         watch him—and just so you know, I tried to talk him out of it.”</p>
      <p>Cassie looked at T, the ground, the walls, and the piles of laundry. Anywhere but
         the
         body between her and Caleb. Finally, her eyes rested on the interwoven symbol inked
         on
         the top of James’ left hand, the words Tus Nua printed underneath. His fingers were
         long; the nails appeared manicured. The letters, T.A.K.E were scrolled above his
         knuckles. The gold band of an aquamarine ring obscured the top of the A</p>
      <p>Her gaze jumped to his stomach, stretched flat between his hip bones. The inked letter
         I
         sat at the top of a curved design; the rest of the image remained hidden beneath his
         pants. She tilted her head, to try to view the narrow gap between the button of his
         jeans and his skin. The shiver that played between her shoulder blades, shot down
         her
         spine.</p>
      <p>“I can't believe Salvia did this.” Caleb regained some color. He pushed up James’
         shirtsleeve and inspected the skin. “Cassie, check his other arm.”</p>
      <p>James’ hand twitched, warm against her palm. The underside of his wrist housed a skull
         tattoo. A cross and more foreign words covered his forearm. The ink made it difficult
         to
         see anything, and with no experience in the body checking category, she was lost.
         “What
         am I looking for?”</p>
      <p>“Needle marks,” T answered.</p>
      <p>Stirring, James’ eyes flickered open, a circle of sea green ringed his dilated pupils.
         He pulled his arm from Caleb’s grasp. “No needles, Callie.”</p>
      <p>James’ gaze caught hers and held. She inhaled so sharply Caleb jerked his head up.
         At
         that moment, she didn’t care. Everything but James faded into obscurity.</p>
      <p>He blinked up at her. “Are you my angel?”</p>
      <p>She dropped his hand.</p>
      <p>Caleb sat back on his heels and looked toward T. “God, he's still tripping. Do you
         have
         his keys?”</p>
      <p>“He didn't give them to me.”</p>
      <p>Groaning, Caleb patted James’ wet, front pockets.</p>
      <p>“Screw off.” James pushed the intrusion away.</p>
      <p>Caleb easily caught James’ wrist. He pinned it under his knee, then reached into the
         left pocket. His disgusted expression relieved the tightness coiled inside her and
         she
         chuckled.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s scowl deepened. “What are you laughing at? You’re his angel. You should do
         this.” He pulled out a keyring and wiped them on his shorts before tossing them into
         her
         lap. “You’re driving, remember. That was his Mustang I parked in front of. Help me
         get
         him on his feet.”</p>
      <p>Obeying, she looped her arm around James’ middle where it rested against the warmth
         of
         his lower back. An unfamiliar bubble tickled her insides.</p>
      <p>T followed them to the front door.</p>
      <p>Caleb held out his hand. “Where's his phone?”</p>
      <p>She retrieved an iPhone from the cluttered coffee table and dropped it into Caleb’s
         palm.</p>
      <p>“Anything else?” Caleb said, “if he can't find his wallet tomorrow, I'm coming
         back.”</p>
      <p>T unlocked the door and yanked it open. “You have it all.”</p>
      <p>Caleb carried most of James weight as he maneuvered through the doorway. “Thanks for
         calling.”</p>
      <p>“Not a problem.” T slammed the door, leaving them on the tiny cement landing.</p>
      <p>James' body tensed against Cassie’s side.</p>
      <p>“Callie?” he blurted out like a frightened child. “Ta' slaghda'n orm!” The words were
         slurred and not English.</p>
      <p>“We're almost to the car.” Caleb quickened his pace and she struggled to keep up.</p>
      <p>They made the street, but James stopped short. “I'm gonna boke.” He gagged.</p>
      <p>Cassie didn’t need experience to recognize that sound. She jumped off the curb. James
         heaved once, nothing but liquid, and Caleb shouldered him the remaining few steps
         toward
         the car.</p>
      <p>“It’s okay.” He braced James’ hands against the hood. “You'll be home in a bit.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe you should call an ambulance,” Cassie suggested.</p>
      <p>Caleb gave her an incredulous look and she kicked at the broken asphalt under her
         sandals. “How often do you do this?”</p>
      <p>“Go scumming? Me, never.” He kept his focus on James. “Usually, our nights are a bit
         more upscale and sometimes it's me that needs to be brought home. But it's alcohol
         I'm
         sick on, no drugs. Well, maybe a little weed. But nothing stronger.”</p>
      <p>“How come he didn't get you to be his sitter?” It made more sense to her.</p>
      <p>“Because he knows I would never let him do this,” he waved both arms at James, “to
         himself. Booze is one thing but look at him.”</p>
      <p>James’ breathing regulated, but his arms vibrated. His eyes skated over her, to Caleb.
         “How did I get here?”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s posture tensed. “You don’t remember coming here? At all? Tell me this wasn’t
         an
         episode.”</p>
      <p>“Scith a ligean, Arsehole.” James’ gaze caught hers.</p>
      <p>Caleb glanced at her as well. “Screw off, James,” he said, “I am relaxed.”</p>
      <p>He helped James into the back seat then leaned in to click the seatbelt. After shutting
         the door, he faced her. “Follow me. And don't worry; I plan on going slow.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie had no problem shadowing the bright orange Charger. She parked behind them
         on the
         concrete driveway. “Should I leave his car here?”</p>
      <p>Caleb nodded. He opened the Charger’s door and adjusted the driver’s seat forward,
         as
         far as it could go. James had piled up in the back. He jumped when Caleb reached for
         him.</p>
      <p>“It’s me.” Caleb reached in again. “You’re good.”</p>
      <p>He propped James against the car where he promptly slid into a squat. A groan floated
         up
         from under his hair.</p>
      <p>“Stay with him.” Caleb threw her an apologetic smile. “I’m going into the house for
         the
         first aid kit. I’ll be right back.”</p>
      <p>James swiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then peered up at her through his
         bangs. He smiled. “My angel still here.”</p>
      <p>He sounded more lucid, but she couldn’t narrow down his garbled accent other than
         somewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Bit by bit, he inched his way up the car then lounged against it, as if they were
         hanging out on a normal night. It might have been more believable if his attire wasn’t
         a
         complete disaster. Despite the situation, his expression remained confident.</p>
      <p>“Hi. I’m James.” He looked downward, at himself, then back to her. His smile widened.
         “My greatest apologies for being such a mess.”</p>
      <p>A dab of blood formed on his split lip, which he licked.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s warning flashed through her brain. James was unpredictable and charming—a
         hot
         mess. What kind of person would do this to themselves? He pushed himself off the car
         and
         headed through the gate into the backyard, towards the pool house.</p>
      <p>Since she was supposed to keep an eye on him, she followed.</p>
      <p>The screen door in the main house slammed shut and Caleb came up behind them. “Whoa.
         I
         told you to wait for me.”</p>
      <p>James opened the pool house door. “Is gá dom a bhaint as an seomra folctha.” He stepped
         into the bright room.</p>
      <p>A blast of frigid air hit Cassie as she followed.</p>
      <p>Caleb scooted past her. “Ta tu ro-dheanach, dude,”</p>
      <p>Unsure what to do, she lounged cross armed against the wall. “What did he say?”</p>
      <p>“That he needs to use the bathroom.” Caleb shook his head. “I told him it was too
         late.”</p>
      <p>James glared at Caleb. “Póg mo thóin, Cal.” Jutting his chin toward her, he added,
         “You
         can kiss my ass too, Luv, if you like.”</p>
      <p>“Rude,” she said, but bit back a smile.</p>
      <p>James hit the light switch, leaving them in the glow of the television. He stumbled
         across the room, toward the bedroom.</p>
      <p>“Wait.” Caleb flicked the light on. “You’re not crashing. I need to check out that
         cut
         and your clothes are… gross.”</p>
      <p>“I planned on stripping, Mam.” James let his shirt slide off his shoulders and undid
         his
         jeans.</p>
      <p>“James.” Caleb pointed to her, still by the door. “We have company.”</p>
      <p>She waved.</p>
      <p>Caleb pulled one of the chairs away from the tiny bistro table. “Come over here.”
         He
         patted the wood. “Sit. Please.”</p>
      <p>With an unhappy grunt, James sat. His eyes found hers and stuck. If he thought she
         would
         rescue him, he was mistaken.</p>
      <p>“Cassie.” Caleb opened the first aid kit then lit the flashlight on his phone. “Can
         you
         please go soak a cloth in hot water?”</p>
      <p>When she headed toward the kitchen sink, he added, “in the bathroom.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A neat stack of folded face cloths occupied a basket on the bathroom counter. Cassie
         selected one and held it under the hot water. After a minute, she wrung it out then
         shut
         the water off. A hushed conversation floated from the next room.</p>
      <p>“Damn it.” There was a hint of pleading in Caleb’s voice. “I know you have a death
         wish
         but think about Mom. Think about me.”</p>
      <p>“You?” said James, “I haven't seen you since that Soith moved next door.”</p>
      <p>She gasped. Whatever a soith was, it didn’t sound pleasant. James hated her, and didn’t
         even know her.</p>
      <p>“That’s what this is all about?” Caleb was no longer whispering. “You’re jealous?
         Don't
         you realize what it does to me to have to pick you up like that? Covered in blood
         and
         piss. Fuck. Slow down. I can't keep up.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t try, then.” James coughed. “Stop fussing over me. Go play with your
         girlfriend.”</p>
      <p>Cassie heard enough. They quieted as she entered the room. “How’s the patient?” she
         asked, handing over the face cloth.</p>
      <p>“Crashing.” Caleb scowled. “And in a foul mood.” He pressed the cloth against James’
         forehead.</p>
      <p>Water trickled down James’ cheeks and he shirked away. “I want her to do it.”</p>
      <p>“Fuck off, James.” Caleb hovered the cloth over the wound. “Stay still.”</p>
      <p>James knocked Caleb’s hand away. He glowered at Cassie. “Hurry up. I already told
         you, I
         need to piss, and go to bed. Preferably in that order.”</p>
      <p>“Damn it.” Caleb shoved the cloth at her. “Do you mind? There’s no point arguing with
         him. He won't remember anything in the morning.”</p>
      <p>“Come on, angel.” James smirked. “I won't bite…unless you want me to.”</p>
      <p>Caleb sighed. “Stop being such an ass. Tip your head back and shut up.”</p>
      <p>The cloth felt foreign in Cassie’s grip, the role of caretaker unfamiliar. Nobody
         needed
         her. Ever. She pushed James’ hair back, then pressed the material against his cut.
         The
         muscle in his jaw clenched. He placed his hand over hers.</p>
      <p>“You’re done.” Caleb removed James’ hand. “You'll have to make do with me. Your angel
         is
         leaving.”</p>
      <p>James kept his gaze on her but remained cooperative as Caleb finished cleaning the
         area,
         applied first aid cream, then slapped on a couple of butterfly bandages.</p>
      <p>“Do you need help to the bathroom?” Caleb asked.</p>
      <p>“Feck off, Cal.” The chair teetered, as James got to his feet. He raised an eyebrow
         at
         Cassie, then staggered to the sofa where he fell face-first onto the cushions.</p>
      <p>It took Cassie a few seconds to notice Caleb held the door open.</p>
      <p>“That was awkward,” she offered as she stepped into the night. “And just so you know,
         he
         forgot to pee.”</p>
      <p>Caleb took her hand and hurried her through the gate. “He'll probably get up in the
         middle of the night and break his nose on the bathroom sink. But hell, I tried.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>They reached her front door. Dark windows informed her; her mother was in bed.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for being there for me tonight,” Caleb said, as she dug her key out of her
         purse, “James is a train wreck, but I'm all he has.”</p>
      <p> “You said his parents were wack jobs. What happened to them?”</p>
      <p>“His stepdads in Statesville prison, an hour’s drive from here.” Caleb glanced down.
         “Hopefully, his mothers in hell. She hung herself about a year and a half ago. James
         got
         all her cash—and she had a lot of it.” He met her eyes. “Don't let on you know any
         of
         this.”</p>
      <p>“That’s horrible.” James’ issues were more serious than she’d imagined. “If I ever
         see
         him again, my lips are sealed.</p>
      <p>He kissed her forehead. “About that. I haven’t spent much time with him lately—and
         need
         to keep him close. What I’m saying is, James is going to hang with us more often.”</p>
      <p>A tiny pulse of adrenaline flitted through Cassie’s body. Small enough to ignore.
         She
         smiled. “I promise I won't run away with him.”</p>
      <p>It was a joke, but Caleb’s expression remained blank.</p>
      <p>She stuck the key in the lock. “I thought you didn't want me around him.”</p>
      <p>“I also don't want to attend his funeral.” Caleb backed off the steps. “Sorry our
         evening ended so crazy.”</p>
      <p>It had been crazy, but also exhilarating, and a far cry from her evenings in Kansas.
         She
         would have told him it was fine, but he disappeared through the gate before she could
         reply.</p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
