         <h4>Chapter 14</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Cassie darted around Caleb as he grappled with the stranger. She sunk to the ground
         beside James and spread his jacket across his chest. “Stay still,” she said, her hand
         on
         his.</p>
      <p>“I called 911.” Ron squatted across from her, phone in his hand.</p>
      <p>Good thing Ron’s brain worked, calling for assistance hadn’t entered her mind and
         Caleb
         was no help. He hovered over the attacker; fists clamped on the guy’s jacket.</p>
      <p>The guy kicked, legs flailing, shoes scraping the concrete, an attempt to secure a
         foothold. She hadn’t pegged Caleb as a fighter, but fury darkened his eyes. Knuckles
         bloodied, he raised his fist and pummeled it into the guy’s cheek.</p>
      <p>Cassie tucked her legs against her torso, as the stranger's body thumped onto the
         pavement. He turned toward her; his face bloody but recognizable—the guy hanging around
         their pool table. His eyes were open, but he stayed down. Caleb kicked him in the
         ribs.</p>
      <p>“Jesus, Caleb. Stop.” Ron grabbed Caleb’s arm and pulled him back. “You’re going to
         kill
         him.”</p>
      <p>“I told you something was up.” Panting, Caleb motioned to a black billfold laying
         open
         on the pavement. “Check his wallet.”</p>
      <p>The guy remained motionless as Ron rifled through the wallet. He waved a license at
         Caleb. “Leonardo Wallace.”</p>
      <p>The name meant nothing to her. She sandwiched James’ hand between both of hers, trying
         to warm it up. The distant wail of sirens released the tightness around her esophagus
         and relief seeped from her lungs.</p>
      <p>“Never heard of him.” Caleb sunk down beside her, breathing wild. “Fuck, James, you’ve
         got a knife sticking out of you. I don't know how to fix this.” He jerked his head
         to
         Cassie, his eyes wide. “This guy came to see him.”</p>
      <p>In a frenzied motion, he jumped to his feet and rifled through James’ pockets. Blood
         oozed from around the knife handle.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” Ron sounded sick. “You’re going to make him worse.”</p>
      <p>Caleb flipped her James’ wallet, phone, and a pack of cigarettes. “Keep these on you,”
         he instructed. There was blood on the phone, but she dropped all three items into
         her
         purse.</p>
      <p>“Holy shit. Is he dead?” Ron’s face turned a greenish-yellow, “You never move someone
         with a knife sticking out of them. You probably fucking killed him.”</p>
      <p>“Shut up!” Caleb towered over Ronnie, like he planned to hit him, too.</p>
      <p>“Whoa, Caleb. Hold up. I didn’t do this.” Tossing Leonardo’s wallet onto the ground,
         Ron
         backed toward the door. “I'm taking off. My dad will kill me if I get in trouble.
         He's
         trying to become a district judge.” He yanked on the metal handle, but the door had
         locked from the inside.</p>
      <p>“Damn.” He kicked the door, then sprinted to the alley’s far end. He wormed his way
         between the building and a broken metal fence as a white sedan bearing the words Chicago
         Police appeared street-side.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The police exited their car and navigated past debris, down the long alley. Cassie
         squeezed James’ fingers. Where was the ambulance?</p>
      <p>“Everyone stay where you are.” The heavier officer took a few quick pictures then
         pulled
         out a notepad and pen. He led Caleb a few feet away. “Can you tell me what went on
         here?”</p>
      <p>With a moan, Leonardo rolled over, unfurling his body. His features were swollen and
         twisted. Hair, matted with blood, stuck to his face.</p>
      <p>“Stay where you are, sir.” A lanky blond officer picked up Leonardo’s wallet then
         knelt
         in front of James. He eyed her over his radio, brows raised. “Area is secure,” he
         informed whoever was on the receiving end. His gaze tipped downward, and he laid two
         fingers against James' neck.</p>
      <p>Not wanting to read what his face might tell her; she studied his nametag. Officer
         McGilvery.</p>
      <p>He lifted his radio. “We have one unconscious male, a knife wound to his lower abdomen,
         weapon in place. And one conscious male, with cuts and contusions, possible internal
         injuries.”</p>
      <p>“Are you injured?” he asked Cassie, as he pulled a card from Leonardo’s wallet.</p>
      <p>She shook her head.</p>
      <p>“Can you ID the boy with the knife wound?” The officer pulled out a note pad.</p>
      <p>She blinked back tears. “James Fitzpatrick.</p>
      <p>The officer’s pen scratched across the paper. “Did you call this in?”</p>
      <p>Unable to find her voice, she shook her head again. The officer’s attention drifted
         to
         the man on the ground. “Are you Leonardo Wallace?”</p>
      <p>“Yes,” the man muttered.</p>
      <p>The wail of sirens grew, and the front end of an ambulance appeared behind the cruiser.
         Two paramedics wheeled a gurney around the corner, followed by another man.</p>
      <p>“I need your ID and a statement.” Officer McGilvery’s voice remained calm as his gaze
         settled on her. “Just tell me what you saw.”</p>
      <p>Cassie twisted to see Caleb, but couldn’t see past the heavier cop. She handed over
         her
         license. “We didn’t see anything.”</p>
      <p>“When you say we, who are you referring to?” He handed her ID back then stooping,
         rifled
         through James’ jacket pockets.</p>
      <p>“Me and Caleb.” She pointed to Caleb. “We were shooting pool. James went outside.
         When
         he didn't come back, we went looking for him.” She choked back a sob.</p>
      <p>The cop scratched his chin. “What was your friend doing in the alley?”</p>
      <p>“I have no idea.” She hadn’t thought about it, but if drugs were involved, Caleb gave
         her the evidence. She tried not to glance at her purse.</p>
      <p>The paramedics abandoned the gurney and carried what looked like a long surfboard.
         She
         stumbled back to give them room.</p>
      <p>“Sit down, honey.” The female paramedic touched her arm. “I'm Claire. What's your
         name?”</p>
      <p>“Cassie,” She said, but couldn’t sit. No matter where she looked, she saw the knife
         sticking out of James.</p>
      <p>The paramedics eased James onto the backboard, then applied a neck brace. He remained
         unconscious. A red blotch stained the cement, darker in the center where James’ blood
         seeped into the pavement. Her stomach bubbled up the back of her throat. Turning away,
         she wrapped her arms around herself.</p>
      <p>Leonardo teetered to his feet. “Get away from me.” He lashed out at the medical
         personnel and leered at Caleb, “Better watch your back, asshole.”</p>
      <p>Caleb lunged toward Leonardo. Two more officers appeared in the opening of the alley.
         They ran forward, dodging garbage.</p>
      <p>Cassie stared open-mouthed as Caleb knocked one of the paramedics on his butt and
         sprang
         toward an unprepared Leonardo. The sucker punch connected. It was the only hit Caleb
         got
         in before the new officers tackled him.</p>
      <p>“My nose!” Fresh blood oozed between Leonardo’s fingers. “You’re dead.”</p>
      <p>“You better hope my friend isn’t,” Caleb said into the gravel. He struggled to get
         free
         as the short officer slapped a set of cuffs on his wrists.</p>
      <p>“Who owns the weapon?” Officer McGilvery asked as Leonardo made it to his feet.</p>
      <p>“It’s his knife.” Leonardo pointed to Caleb. “You just saw. He wants to kill me. Let
         me
         go. I didn’t do anything.”</p>
      <p>Officer McGilvery shook his head. “Are you going to deny that a minute ago, you
         threatened to kill him? I bet your prints are on that knife?”</p>
      <p>Leonardo stared toward the ground as one of the officers searched him. They pulled
         a
         ziplocked bag of pills from his pants pocket.</p>
      <p>“Take him to the station,” Officer McGilvery said, and the two new officers brushed
         past
         her, flanking Leonardo.</p>
      <p>“Get off me.” Caleb struggled against the knee in his back. “I can’t see anything.”</p>
      <p>The short cop pulled on Caleb’s hand cuffs. “I’m going to stand you up, search you,
         and
         walk you to the police car. Understand.”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir,” Caleb spit the words out. The officer jerked Caleb to his feet just as
         the
         paramedics walked past, James buckled to the backboard.</p>
      <p>“Fuck.” Caleb’s eyes widened. “You’ve got to unbuckle him.” He pushed backward, into
         the
         officer, then tried to dart forward. The officer caught the cuffs and forced him against
         the wall.</p>
      <p>“You don’t understand.” Bricks muffled Caleb’s voice. “If he wakes up, tied down,
         he’ll
         freak. Fuck. Cassie, go with him.”</p>
      <p>She froze. Was that even a possibility?</p>
      <p>“I’ll cooperate.” Caleb’s voice cracked. “But let her ride with my friend. She might
         calm him down. You don’t want him to struggle, right?”</p>
      <p>Officer McGilvery raised his brows, then sighed. “Hold up,” he called to the paramedics.
         You have a passenger.” He shrugged at his partner. “Let her ride in the back.”</p>
      <p>“Go Cassie.” Caleb slumped against the wall. “Stay with him.”</p>
      <p>She reached the end of the alley when Caleb yelled. “Tell them his last name is
         O'Sullivan.”</p>
      <p>Claire held out her hand to help Cassie into the back of the ambulance. “Are you
         eighteen?” she asked before shutting the door.</p>
      <p>Cassie nodded. “I am.”</p>
      <p>“Buckle into the jump seat.” Claire motioned to a small seat attached to the bulkhead.
         The siren sounded and they rolled into Chicago’s traffic. </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
