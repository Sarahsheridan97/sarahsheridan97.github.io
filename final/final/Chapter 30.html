         <h4>Chapter 30</h4>
      </div>
      <p>The taxi screeched to a halt a couple of blocks from James’ house. The driver twisted
         in
         his seat. “Get out!”</p>
      <p>He continued to spew a fountain of verbiage, none of which James understood, but the
         shaking fist meant the odds were good, the guy wanted to deck him.</p>
      <p>James opened the door, and a gust of wind infiltrated the taxi. Bent trees waved their
         branches, creating frantic shadows in the darkness. In his current state, he’d never
         make the two blocks home before the storm hit. Perhaps he should have refrained from
         stating the cute brown-haired girl in the photo stuck to the dash, would look hot
         sucking his huge Irish mickey.</p>
      <p>He tossed a fifty on the front seat. “Aw. Come on.”</p>
      <p>“Jow.” The driver picked up his phone. “I call the police.”</p>
      <p>“Cuir do ghuthán ar shiúl. Asshole.” James glared at him in the mirror. The dude wasn’t
         the only one able to speak a foreign language. “No cops. I’m leaving.”</p>
      <p>He spilled onto the sidewalk and tried to slam the door for dramatic flair, but the
         cab
         roared off before it could latch, leaving him alone in the dark. A loud thunderclap
         echoed from the east. A warning to get moving.</p>
      <p>Staggering down his neighborhood street wasn’t cool but passing out on the curb was
         a
         sure way to spend the night on a cement bench in a jail cell. An experience he already
         lived through; twice since he'd last seen Cassie.</p>
      <p>He veered left into the alley, turned right into his yard, and leaned over the railing
         to urinate off the small wooden landing of his back entrance.</p>
      <p>“James?” Cassie’s voice came from somewhere behind him.</p>
      <p>He caught a glimpse of her over his shoulder. She stood in the shadows, her white
         dress
         blowing around her making her appear more like a celestial body than his best friend's
         girl. She’d held the number one spot on his avoidance list all week, since the whole
         Roxanne thing. Caleb’s name followed. Then the entire world. May as well say, fuck
         everyone.</p>
      <p>“Go home,” he said, “you’re going to get wet.”</p>
      <p>Leaving his pants undone, he unlocked the door and felt his way down the stairs, into
         the cocoon of his apartment. Soft footsteps told him Cassie followed. He kicked his
         shoes off, flicked the bathroom light on, and yanked his shirt over his head as he
         stumbled to his bed. He sprawled face forward on the mattress.</p>
      <p>The bed moved with Cassie’s slight weight. “I wanted to talk to you.”</p>
      <p>James coughed up a laugh, but the hair on his arms prickled. “If you are here to tell
         me
         about your romp with Cal, you're too late. Already heard everything.”</p>
      <p>Caleb told him every detail as soon as Roxanne left. How firm Cassie's breasts were,
         how
         tight she'd been.</p>
      <p>His gut churned the whole time, but he’d grinned and even threw in a couple of lewd
         comments. Afterward he’d excused himself to wash Roxanne's stink off and throw up
         on the
         shower floor. To make matters worse, Caleb only told him the details because he’d
         demanded to know. He had put himself in this crazy position.</p>
      <p>He’d made it to work that morning, then picked up a bottle of vodka and caught a
         southbound train to Traci's. The remainder of the week was spent trying to find balance
         between staying sober enough to function, but not sober enough to think.</p>
      <p>“Caleb told you?” She sounded wounded.</p>
      <p>He wanted to laugh at her niavete, except laughing seemed wrong, and suddenly he felt
         like crying.</p>
      <p>“Did he tell you everything, or just that we did it?”</p>
      <p>“I'm not talking about Cal and you fucking.” The words tasted bitter. Still on his
         belly, he fumbled his phone out of his pocket. “It’s past midnight. Why are you
         here?”</p>
      <p>“I wanted to see you.”</p>
      <p>“You’ve seen me. You can go.”</p>
      <p>“Stop it. I’m worried about you. You’ve been MIA for days.” She sniffled. “Does your
         disappearance have anything to do with me sleeping with Caleb?”</p>
      <p>“Of course not. You can do whatever you want—so can I.”</p>
      <p>He had—six times. Seven if he counted Roxanne. Useless attempts to block out the memory
         of Cassie's lips on his. He buried his face in his pillow. “Things aren’t always about
         you.”</p>
      <p>“But you kissed me. I wondered…”</p>
      <p>“And you gave me an out. Frenemies, remember. I shouldn't have kissed you. I'm sorry
         it
         happened.” It was the best he could offer. “Can I pass out now?”</p>
      <p>“What have you been doing all week?” she asked, making it apparent she had no intentions
         of leaving. “I have no right to ask, but I want to know.”</p>
      <p>He almost laughed. “No, you don't.”</p>
      <p>“I have no right to ask? Or I don't want to know?”</p>
      <p>“Both.”</p>
      <p>The sudden weight of her body as she straddled his waist, surprised him. Her face
         pressed against the back of his neck, raising the fine hair that ran down his spine.
         “Do
         you always have to smell so good?”</p>
      <p>His stomach butterflied and it wasn’t from the booze. “Stop it. I'm too drunk to take
         advantage of whatever is going through your head.”</p>
      <p>“You realize you said that out loud?” </p>
      <p>He did. But he’d kept his second thought private—the desire to hold her all night.
         That
         idea scared the hell out of him.</p>
      <p>“Go home,” he said to the wall. It would respond the same. “Cut me some slack.
         Please.”</p>
      <p>“Saying please is so unlike you, James.”</p>
      <p>She traced circles between his shoulder blades. Her feathered touch stole his oxygen
         and
         his entire body heated from the warmth of her inner thighs. He tensed, muscles
         hardening. Couldn't she tell how her proximity killed him?</p>
      <p>She stopped sketching. “Where were you drinking tonight?”</p>
      <p>“Alexa's.” It wasn’t a lie; he’d seen her once.</p>
      <p>“Have you been drunk all week?” The slight change in her voice mimicked Caleb's when
         he
         tried to conceal his concern.</p>
      <p>“Sober for work,” he said. If he gave her the answers she wanted, maybe she’d
         disappear.</p>
      <p>“Work? Where do you work?”</p>
      <p>He hadn't meant to say that, but the blood had drained from his brain. To his amazement,
         she let it slide. Instead, she kissed a hot pathway to the small of his back then
         tugged
         his pants lower so her tongue could touch the base of his spine. She sucked on his
         skin
         like she wanted to give him a hickey, before kissing her way back up.</p>
      <p>He flattened out, pushing his hips into three inches of memory foam.</p>
      <p>“James. Roll over. I’m trying to get your attention. We need to talk.”</p>
      <p>Jaysus, she had one hundred percent of his attention. He rose to his elbows and she
         shifted her weight, allowing him to flip over. She settled on his groin, his jeans
         halfway down his hips. Thanks to her fashion choice, only two layers of cotton underwear
         separated her from him.</p>
      <p>“How many times?” He chewed on his bottom lip, barely able to contain the urge to
         buck
         his hips upward and sink into her softness.</p>
      <p>“How many times what?”</p>
      <p>He covered his eyes with his arm. “How many times have you been with Cal?”</p>
      <p>“Once. Only once. I haven't even seen him for a couple of days. I think he's been
         searching for you.”</p>
      <p>He removed his arm. “Did you like it?”</p>
      <p>The space between her eyebrows narrowed. “You can have any girl you want.”</p>
      <p>“Answer the question, Cassie”</p>
      <p>She gazed down at him like he was transparent. “You admitted you sleep with whomever,
         just because you can.”</p>
      <p>Water pelted the windows, the beginning of the storm. A thunderclap made her jerk.
         He
         laced his fingers through hers. “What if I said I wanted you right now?”</p>
      <p>“You don’t. Not like Caleb does. You want to use me.”</p>
      <p>Grinning, he tugged her closer, even though his words would push her away. “Yeah,
         angel,” he said, “I'll use you tonight and tomorrow. Maybe for a couple of years.”</p>
      <p>He kept smiling but closed his eyes.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>“What does that mean?” Why did he always say the exact opposite of what she could
         read
         on his face? “You just admitted you're using me?”</p>
      <p>Nothing about her encounters with James made concrete sense, but right now, the way
         he
         looked at her was solid and very real.</p>
      <p>His smile faded. “You didn't answer me. Did you like being with Cal?”</p>
      <p>She buried her head into the crook of his neck and slipped her words into his ear.
         “I
         have nothing to compare it to.”</p>
      <p>His breathing hitched. “Do you want something to compare it to?”</p>
      <p>She nodded. Her forehead brushed the rough patch on his chin and her heart exploded
         into
         an insistent mantra, sex would be better with James. A single glance from him dissolved
         her into a puddle and holding his hand felt like an intimate gesture. She wanted him
         inside her. It was the only way she’d get enough of him.</p>
      <p>One time. That’s it. Then she would know what being with him was like. If she ever
         planned to get James out of her system, she needed to do this. He didn’t move so she
         jiggled against him. Guilt should have swallowed her whole, but nothing outside of
         James’ room mattered.</p>
      <p>Molten warmth seeped through her as he slid his hands under her dress, then snaked
         them
         against the bare skin of her waist. They may as well be in her panties—the reaction
         would be the same. She sat upright to breathe.</p>
      <p>“Where are you going, angel?” His throaty tone teased her ears.</p>
      <p>“Nowhere. I just want to look at you.”</p>
      <p>“See me then.” He blinked up at her, his eyes dark. “Tar anseo.”</p>
      <p>The words were foreign, but it didn’t matter. He pulled her down and their lips
         collided. His tongue filled her mouth. She wanted to experience every inch of him,
         in
         ways that embarrassed her just thinking about them. He broke away, panting.</p>
      <p>“Take your dress off.” He grabbed the hem and removed it for her, then unhooked her
         bra
         and pulled it off her shoulders.</p>
      <p>She scooted downward, to his thighs. His unblinking expression and the rapid rise
         and
         fall of his chest were as hot as what lay, still concealed under the cotton of his
         briefs. She drifted her fingers back and forth across the bare skin above the waistband
         of his underwear. The word unity fully visible.</p>
      <p>“When did this happen?” She trailed her finger down the obvious lump underneath the
         cotton.</p>
      <p>“Around the time you started kissing my back.”</p>
      <p>His honest answer cracked her heart open. Wanting him bare, she tugged his jeans to
         indicate her intentions. </p>
      <p>He frowned but wiggled his hips and shimmied out of his pants.</p>
      <p>“You do remember you are topless?” he pointed out. “Not that I'm not enjoying the
         show—but you're so engrossed in me, I think you might have forgotten.”</p>
      <p>“I am engrossed in you.”</p>
      <p>Hungry was the more appropriate word. She slipped her finger under the waistband of
         his
         boxer briefs.</p>
      <p>His hand, caressing her waist, stilled.</p>
      <p>She met his gaze.</p>
      <p>“I feel like an experiment,” he said, after a second.</p>
      <p>“You sort of are. Is that okay?”</p>
      <p>“It's kind of hot in a weird way. Most girls never ask me what I want.”</p>
      <p>Cassie nodded, her hand still on his belly, waiting for permission. “I want to see
         you.
         Is that okay?” Words that should have embarrassed her, didn’t.</p>
      <p>“Angel, I'm too wrecked to do much—which is a good thing.” He narrowed his eyes. “I’ve
         never let anyone do this before—have their way with me, and you are the last person
         I
         should.” He sighed. “I’m going to bloody hell.”</p>
      <p>Until now, she hadn’t believed his claims of not letting girls touch him. With her
         eyes
         locked on his, she dipped her fingers beneath his waistband, teasing the skin of his
         abdomen. Her knuckles brushed his erection.</p>
      <p>His eyes widened.</p>
      <p>“Are you okay?” She paused again.</p>
      <p>He nodded, but his face was unreadable.</p>
      <p>Smiling, she plucked at the material. “Really, James. Plain white. Do you always buy
         such boring undergarments?”</p>
      <p>“I don't buy my kacks.”</p>
      <p>“Hmm. Who does your shopping?”</p>
      <p>He shrugged.</p>
      <p>“Well, I’m going to buy you some with polka dots or hearts on them.”</p>
      <p>“Take them off if they bother you that much.” His tone was smooth. </p>
      <p>With shaking hands, she uncovered the rest of the tattoo. A skull with a cross on
         its
         forehead, its skeletal forearms crossed underneath. It held guns in its bony grip.</p>
      <p>A couple of inches from the skull, the scar from the knife had healed into a thin
         red
         line. Beside it was another tattoo, a handle of what appeared to be a sword. The
         letters, Niʹ Bhr printed on the blade, ran downward, over his hip bone.</p>
      <p>“Keep going,” he whispered as she tugged his briefs to his thighs to expose every
         vulnerable inch of him.</p>
      <p>He sucked in a deep breath. The motion resonated through her body and again she met
         his
         gaze, amazed he allowed this.</p>
      <p>“What?” He propped himself up on his elbows. “Speak, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>“You're—” What were the right words?</p>
      <p>“Large. Yeah, I know.”</p>
      <p>“I was going to say hairless.”</p>
      <p>A deep blush covered his face, apparent even in the half-lit room. “I know that
         too.”</p>
      <p>“Why?”</p>
      <p>“It shows off the artwork better.”</p>
      <p>“What's the point if nobody sees it?”</p>
      <p>“You're seeing it.”</p>
      <p>Her eyes flicked back to his tattoos. The rest of the quote read, Niʹ Bhrisfear Meʹ.
         It
         was written lengthwise down the blade of a short sword. She ran the tip of her finger
         along the letters. They were raised, like they were on a ridge, but between the dim
         light and the ink, she couldn’t see why. “What does the verse say.”</p>
      <p>“Loosely, it means I won’t be broken.” He lay back, his arm over his face, and inhaled
         a
         breath deep enough to lift his rib cage. “That’s enough.”</p>
      <p>“Do you want me to be done?” She frowned.</p>
      <p>His chest rose again. “You look with your eyes, not your hands.”</p>
      <p>“So, you don't want me to do this?” She wrapped her fingers around the velvet skin
         of
         his penis. Surprised by its firmness she rubbed her thumb along its length. Something
         inside her tightened.</p>
      <p>He blew out a puff of air but it didn’t stop her.</p>
      <p>She swallowed. “Does your skull tattoo mean anything?”</p>
      <p>“It means a lot, but if you want an art lesson, you’ll have to stop squeezing my cock.
         You’re driving me mad.”</p>
      <p>She released him and leaned forward enough to uncover his eyes. “I like that I can
         do
         that to you.”</p>
      <p>“You have no idea what you do to me.”</p>
      <p>She had some idea; the physical aspects were obvious. But did he trust her? How far
         would he let her go? What did he smell like? What did he taste like? She would never
         have this opportunity again.</p>
      <p>More relaxed than when she was with Caleb, she hovered her lips just under his belly
         button, her cheek against his erection and inhaled the faint scent of soap. On a whim,
         she ran her tongue up the underside of his penis.</p>
      <p>He jumped. “Holy fuck.”</p>
      <p>“Sorry.” She sat up.</p>
      <p>“Don't be sorry. I’ve never...” He shimmied upward, propping himself against the
         headboard. “It's hard to lay still and let you examine me.”</p>
      <p>“I want to understand how guys work.” How you work, she wanted to say. She wanted
         to
         learn everything about him. “Caleb was the first guy I ever touched… Sorry.” This
         wasn’t
         the time to bring up another guy’s name, especially that one.</p>
      <p>His fingers graced the contour of her neck. “It's okay. Talk. This whole night’s
         bizarre.”</p>
      <p>“It happened so fast with Caleb, and we were under a sheet so it's not like I saw
         anything.”</p>
      <p>“We really are each other’s experiment?” He paused. “Nothing more, nothing less?”</p>
      <p>She nodded, ignoring her heart’s silent pull for more. “You’re all sticky.”</p>
      <p>“My body wants to fuck you.” He kicked his briefs the rest of the way off.</p>
      <p>“But you don’t?”</p>
      <p>He sighed. “Even doused in alcohol, my brain is screaming, it’s a very, very, bad
         idea.”</p>
      <p>James' morality meter dinging before hers set off a tiny alarm in the back of her
         head.
         Even so, she slipped her thumb over the tip of his penis, then placed her lips where
         her
         thumb had been, gently kissing the top. How could something be so hard, feel so soft?
         How could someone be so crazy, be so sweet?</p>
      <p>James remained silent, letting her do what she wanted, but his fingers knotted the
         blankets. She placed her hands over his and squeezed.</p>
      <p>“Come up here, angel. I want to kiss you.” His voice was thick.</p>
      <p>His body, long and lean, twitched under her lips as she kissed her way upward, until
         his
         lips were under hers and his heart thundered against her ribs. A heated tangle of
         limbs
         and tongues, skin on skin.</p>
      <p>Deep kisses drove her to the edge of a cliff and left her hanging. Pressed flat against
         him wasn't close enough. She wrapped her legs around his hips. Still not close enough.
         She maneuvered her position until his hardness rubbed against the crotch of her panties.
         Not close enough.</p>
      <p>James moaned and rolled to his side, taking her with him. “Cassie, I’m not kidding.
         I
         don't want to sleep with you. What we're doing is bad enough.” He closed his eyes,
         his
         breaths fast. “I'm too drunk, anyway.”</p>
      <p>The words punctured her heart. “I happen to know you prefer to be drunk when you have
         sex.” Only something inside her shifted. It wasn't about sex anymore. It was about
         him.
         Experiencing all of him. But he didn't want her, and it hurt.</p>
      <p>He kissed her hand. “I can't think straight right now. All this touching is freaking
         me
         out. Everything is freaking me out.” He inched closer and rested his cheek on her
         curtain of hair, fanned across the pillow. “Can we just fall asleep beside each
         other?”</p>
      <p>“Okay.” She nodded, but disappointment registered in her voice. She blinked back tears.
         He didn’t desire her. Even naked on top of him, he hadn’t touched her. Not really.
         Not
         where she expected he would.</p>
      <p>James flipped around to his favored stomach position. “Did it work?”</p>
      <p>“Huh?”</p>
      <p>“What you said in the hospital. Do you want Cal more now that you have slept with
         him?
         Do you feel more secure?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” she wavered, “sure.”</p>
      <p>James sighed. “I told you it didn't work that way.”</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
