         <h4>Chapter 23</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Caleb turned into the parking lot of the Griffin Williamson campus and shifted into
         park. Not being able to check on James all week was almost as excruciating as seeing
         the
         knife sticking out of his body, and guilt had settled in. He should have stayed sober
         and followed his friend outside. The mistake could have been fatal.</p>
      <p>He swallowed the bad taste in his mouth and picked up his phone. Taking a few minutes
         to
         get his emotions under control couldn’t hurt. It wouldn’t do any good to get James
         in
         the car, then strangle him.</p>
      <p>Locating his mother's number, he typed, Hey, Mom. Arrived safely.</p>
      <p>His mom had been in bed when he left. Her headache eased mid-week but returned last
         night with a vengeance.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>With its huge stone pillars, the campus looked more like a hunting lodge than a
         treatment facility. He pressed the intercom button. After stating his business, the
         door
         clicked open like a jail cell, banishing all thoughts of vacation.</p>
      <p>“Dr. Madison is ready for you,” the receptionist said, handing him a sign-in sheet
         and
         name tag. She crossed the carpeted waiting room and motioned for him to follow.</p>
      <p>The faint smell of vanilla tamed the chill of the sparsely decorated hallways. They
         passed a lunchroom filled with residents before stopping at a dark wooden door, bearing
         the nameplate, Dr. R. Madison. M.D., LCP. The receptionist turned the brass handle,
         and
         despite its impenetrable appearance the door opened, devoid of noise. She gestured
         for
         him to go into the room.</p>
      <p>Large, leather furniture dominated the generous space. Dr. Madison looked up from
         where
         he sat, legs stretched across an ottoman, shoes beside his chair. Sunlight from a
         translucent wall of glass blocks splashed across an unfinished chess game.</p>
      <p>James stood at the glass; forehead pressed against the frosted squares.</p>
      <p>“Hello, Dr. Madison. I’m here to pick up James.” Caleb wiped his hand on his shorts
         before he offered it.</p>
      <p>James turned around. A small grin played on his lips, but his clenched fists and wide
         eyes made it clear he wanted to be free of that room.</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison cleared his throat. “Young Mister Patterson. Nice to see you again.”</p>
      <p>“Thank you for letting me come.” Caleb nodded coolly, but Dr. Madison made him nervous
         as hell. James’ psychiatrist was a constant reminder something was wrong with his
         friend. Something he couldn’t fix.</p>
      <p>James moved away from the window. He ambled down the long wall of books, head tipped
         as
         if searching for something and didn’t care what went on around him, though Caleb
         suspected he listened to every word.</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison waited until James was across the room to speak. “I understand David got
         called out on a flight and Elizabeth is indisposed.”</p>
      <p>James rested his hand on the leather binding of a large book.</p>
      <p>“Plus,” The doctor said, “I consider you more than capable of getting your friend
         home
         in one piece.”</p>
      <p>“Thank you, sir.” Caleb smiled at the doctor who should have known better than to
         assume
         James was not paying attention.</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison retrieved a manila envelope from his desk drawer. “Please make sure your
         mother gets this.”</p>
      <p>“Sweet,” James said from the far corner, “I require an instruction manual.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison stroked his beard. “I hope these last five days have been insightful,
         James.
         If there is a repeat occurrence, I'll recommend the full thirty-day stay.”</p>
      <p>Caleb nodded. “I'll do better, sir—” The pinched features on the doctor’s face stopped
         him short.</p>
      <p>“Caleb, James and I discussed this at length. It is not up to you to keep him safe.
         Who
         is it up to, James?”</p>
      <p>“Me. Yes, I get it.” James turned from the books but failed to meet Dr. Madison’s
         firm
         expression.</p>
      <p>“That's an important lesson—for both of you.” Dr. Madison shook Caleb’s hand again.
         “Remember. PEI, Monday morning in Naperville.” His gaze followed James as he crossed
         the
         room. “I'll be upset if you fail to-show.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll be there.” James made it to the door. “Am I free to go?”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“I can't believe they let you get me.” Rockford disappeared in the rearview mirror
         before James spoke. He rolled the window down and inhaled. “All the way across the
         state. Freedom at last.”</p>
      <p>Wind whipped through the car, making it hard to hear, but Caleb didn’t have the heart
         to
         ask him to shut the window.</p>
      <p>“On a Friday, even.” James grinned. “Who gets released from rehab on Friday? That's
         just
         asking for trouble. What’s that crazy old man thinking?”</p>
      <p>“I think you’re his favorite case. Maybe he's gay.”</p>
      <p>“He's married with children.”</p>
      <p>Caleb shot him a look. “I was joking, asshole. But now I'm wondering how many old
         guys
         have come on to you.”</p>
      <p>“None,” James rummaged through the glove box and pulled out their emergency pack of
         smokes. He lit a cigarette. “How's Mom? Doctor M insinuated she was ill.”</p>
      <p>“Just one of her migraines.”</p>
      <p>“Courtesy of me.”</p>
      <p>“No, it’s not.” Caleb entered the right lane; they blew past a semi. “You know she
         gets
         headaches.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah. They started when I was ten.” James took another drag. “Go ahead. Deny it.”</p>
      <p>Caleb couldn’t. His mother’s migraines started when James was ten, the month he came
         to
         live with them. “What did you do in there, anyway?”</p>
      <p>“What do you think? Got my brain picked apart by my shrink, ate crappy meals, and
         cried
         myself to sleep every night.”</p>
      <p>“I noticed girls,” Caleb said, “did you at least get laid?”</p>
      <p>“One girl made it clear she would suck dick for smokes. I kept my feckin distance.
         They
         did have a wicked workout room. Despite having to take it easy, I am in better shape
         now
         than I was. At least fighting isn’t on my taboo list.”</p>
      <p>The desire to strangle James returned. Caleb tightened his grip on the wheel. “Blow
         off
         steam another way. There’s no way I’m allowing you to fight.”</p>
      <p>“Allowing me?” James huffed. “You need to lighten up. You heard my doctor. Only I
         am
         responsible for my actions. Which I believe translates into, you not being
         responsible.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll lighten up when you start caring about living. And I don't give a shit what
         your
         doctor says. I know you better than he does.”</p>
      <p>James coughed out smoke. “You realize you're talking about my shrink. I'm supposed
         to
         tell him everything.”</p>
      <p>“Do you?”</p>
      <p>“Yes. No. Maybe. Who cares?”</p>
      <p>Caleb exhaled. “I understand you better than your doctor.”</p>
      <p>“Really?” James took one last drag then flicked his butt out the window. He rolled
         the
         glass up and silence settled in the car. “Do you think I’m out of control?”</p>
      <p>“Sometimes, yeah.” The reply may cause an angry rebuttal, but he wouldn’t be doing
         his
         friend any favors if he didn’t give him an honest answer.</p>
      <p>James stared up at the Charger’s white headliner, giving no clues as to how the comment
         sat. A minute later, he grabbed the sunglasses off the dash and reclined the seat.</p>
      <p>Caleb passed another car. He had a vacation day planned. Cassie screwed him around
         all
         week. Between her and his mother, he needed a break.</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
