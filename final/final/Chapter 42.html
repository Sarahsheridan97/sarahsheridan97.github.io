      <p>Cassie rolled onto her stomach, which made it physically impossible to watch James
         retreat into the house. Still heated from their kiss, she smiled against the cushion.
         I
         like the way you smell, he said.</p>
      <p>It didn’t feel like being with her, hurt him. In fact, the opposite seemed true. He
         appeared crushed at her rejection.</p>
      <p>“Did you and Caleb make up?” Allison stretched across the closest chaise. She shielded
         her eyes from the sun, but the slant of her mouth said she found something entertaining.
         “You’re in his backyard. You must have worked things out.”</p>
      <p>“So, that’s why you’re here?” Cassie raised the back of the chaise. “To get the latest
         gossip?”</p>
      <p>“Allie was worried about you. But that’s why I’m here.” Emily slid her shorts to her
         feet. Her pink, string bikini bottoms matched a skimpy top. She kicked the shorts
         aside.
         “Do you think James will like this?”</p>
      <p>Allison laughed. “He’ll like it alright. Enough to rip it off, then dump you flat.”</p>
      <p>“I want him to rip it off.” Emily glared at them both. “And please, spare me the
         lecture. I can handle James.” She stretched across the third chaise, facedown.</p>
      <p>Cassie bit her tongue; the pool house door swung open and Caleb headed toward them,
         his
         tight yellow swim trunks matching his sallow complexion. He sat a Bose speaker on
         the
         glass end table.</p>
      <p>“Yes, I’m still hungover.” Carefully, he lowered himself onto the pool’s edge, then
         placed his feet in the water. He motioned for Cassie to join him.</p>
      <p>“Must have been some party,” Allison said, “Why wasn’t I invited?”</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t either.” Cassie sat beside Caleb as he scanned Spotify. Beside Caleb, where
         she belonged. “What went on last night?”</p>
      <p>“I told you, I drank too much and checked out mid-evening. Hell, I even broke my phone
         and don’t remember.” Caleb chose a playlist labelled, mellow, and set his phone on
         the
         pavers. “You'll have to ask James—if he ever joins us.”</p>
      <p>On cue, James sauntered from the pool house. He tossed his Cubs ball cap aside and
         attempted the usual flip into the pool but lost his footing. His back slapped the
         water.</p>
      <p>Caleb flinched.</p>
      <p>James pulled himself out and shook off. The movement sent him staggering a few steps
         sideways. He shot Caleb a guilty look. “Aw, feck clean off, Callie. You told me I
         could
         get lit.”</p>
      <p>He picked up his hat and headed over, the waistband of his trunks low enough to expose
         half his skull tattoo.</p>
      <p>“I meant booze, dude.” Caleb sighed. “And I was joking about self-destructing.”</p>
      <p>The tiny triangles of Emily’s bikini strained to keep her large breasts from exposure
         as
         she jumped to her feet. “I almost forgot. We brought stuff to drink.” </p>
      <p>“James doesn’t need any,” Caleb said.</p>
      <p>“Sure, he does.” Emily headed to the gate. “It's in the car. Help me carry it,
         James.”</p>
      <p>James waited for the gate to slam before he followed. “Maybe I can get my dick sucked
         in
         the back seat,” he muttered as he passed them.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s arm slid from her shoulder. “Cuimhneamh ar do ghnó féin.”</p>
      <p>James stopped walking but didn’t turn around. “How come everything I do is your
         business, but nothing you do is mine?”</p>
      <p>The question received a groan from Caleb, though his posture stiffened.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I thought,” James said, as he continued to the garage.</p>
      <p>“Just so you know.” Allison sat on Cassie’s other side and splashed her feet into
         the
         water. “I don’t think even Emily would do that.”</p>
      <p>“Ignore him,” Caleb mumbled red-faced as his arm settled back around her. “He’s working
         through issues—and higher than a kite.”</p>
      <p>She didn’t need to be informed of James’ current state, she could tell for herself.
         Not
         just from James’ slightly off-kilter gait, but from Caleb’s unspoken language of heavy
         sighs and worried groans.</p>
      <p>“Really?” Allison wrinkled her nose, the nuances of James and Caleb’s friendship lost
         on
         her. “What did he take?”</p>
      <p>“Your guess is as good as mine.” Caleb squeezed Cassie tighter. “But if I pass out,
         or
         die from this fucking headache, please make sure he doesn’t drown in our pool.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James returned, carrying two half-filled bottles. A third bottle, bright blue in color,
         stuck out of the front of his trunks. Emily lugged an open box of beer, which she
         dropped at his feet. It looked like they raided someone’s liquor cabinet.</p>
      <p>“I know. The beer is heavier.” James grinned his shameless smile. “But she handed
         me
         these.”</p>
      <p>He set the bottles on the table, then pulled the one from his trunks. His waistband
         slipped lower, enough to see the entire skull. Allison coughed.</p>
      <p>After a brief survey, James unscrewed the bottle with the silver antlers. He took
         a
         drink and swallowed hard.</p>
      <p>Emily reached for the bottle. “Don’t drink all the whiskey.”</p>
      <p>“It’s mostly empty, and it’s Scotch.” James took another drink, this one longer. “Admit
         it, Em. You want me to drink. You figure if I’m all fecked up, I’ll do whatever you
         want.” He put the bottle to Emily’s lips. “There’s just a wee bit left.”</p>
      <p>Emily sputtered but drank. With an accomplished grin, she set the empty bottle down.</p>
      <p>“Em thinks if she drinks James will like her more,” Allison said low enough for only
         the
         three of them to hear.</p>
      <p>“Tell her not to waste her time.” Caleb didn’t bother to hide the disgust in his voice.
         “A lot of girls have tried that same thing—and failed.”</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>No matter how she sat, next to Caleb on the cushioned swing, Cassie could see the
         entire
         pool, including Emily and James foreplay in the water. At one point, she was sure
         James’
         suit was off. She should have left when Allison bailed.</p>
      <p>With James’ help, Emily fumbled out of the deep end. She staggered to the swing and
         wrapped her arms about herself. “Let’s make a fire,” she slurred.</p>
      <p>“Nope,” Caleb answered quick, “it’s not cold enough.”</p>
      <p>“It’s the ambience,” Emily insisted, “It’s pretty at night. We can do marshmallows.”</p>
      <p>James came up behind and draped both arms over Emily’s shoulders, steadying her slight
         sway. “Mom has marshmallows in the house, Cal. If you get them, I’ll start the
         fire.”</p>
      <p>Caleb scowled. “My head’s pounding.” Then, surprising Cassie, he got up and headed
         to
         the house.</p>
      <p>Emily turned around and grabbed James’ neck. She strained upward to get her lips on
         his,
         but he dislodged her grip and led her to the firepit.</p>
      <p>“Wait here,” he said as he sat her on one of the Adirondack chairs. “Don’t move.”</p>
      <p>He disappeared into the pool house. He returned with folded newspaper, then stopped
         to
         pick up one of the tiny piles of neatly cut wood, stacked along the fence.</p>
      <p>He didn't strike Cassie as an outdoorsy type. She walked over to investigate.</p>
      <p>“She’s out.” James chinned to Emily asleep on the chair. He pulled scissors from the
         pocket of his trunks and cut the zip tie securing the wood.</p>
      <p>Cassie raised her brows. “Do you know what you’re doing?”</p>
      <p>“With the fire or Emily?”</p>
      <p>It was obvious he knew what he was doing with Emily. She dropped onto the opposite
         Adirondack and glared at him. “With the fire, asshole.”</p>
      <p>“You didn’t think I was an asshole, earlier.” He arranged the logs over the paper
         then
         pulled matches and a small container of lighter fluid from his other pocket.</p>
      <p>Caleb returned to a cloud of black smoke. He rolled his eyes at Emily, then tossed
         a bag
         of marshmallows at James—followed by a metal skewer, which he threw at James like
         a
         dart.</p>
      <p>“I just took one of mom’s sumatriptan.” Caleb extended his hand. “Come on Cassie.
         Let’s
         go back to the swing. This smoke will kill me.”</p>
      <p>Cassie glanced at James. She couldn’t be with him, but didn't want animosity between
         them, either.</p>
      <p>“I want a marshmallow,” she said. “I’ll be right over.”</p>
      <p>“Give it a few minutes, Cal.” James poked the fire. “The smoke will clear, and I’ll
         give
         your girl what she wants.”</p>
      <p>“She wants a marshmallow,” Caleb called over his shoulder, “grow up.”</p>
      <p>James threaded a few marshmallows on the skewer. When they turned golden, he pointed
         them at her. She took two.</p>
      <p>“Emily,” he called out as he waved the skewer. “Wakey, wakey. Want a marshmallow?”
         He
         plopped the remaining one in his mouth. “Guess not.”</p>
      <p>He ate a couple more without toasting them, then lit a cigarette. He leaned back in
         the
         chair and exhaled a smoke ring.</p>
      <p>“I want another marshmallow.” Cassie tapped his arm with a stick. When that didn’t
         work,
         she used it to lift the brim of his hat.</p>
      <p>“Stop.” He grabbed the stick and threw it towards the fire. “Don’t tell me you want
         to
         be friends, then come onto me. Christ, I’m supposed to be the fucked-up one.”</p>
      <p>She slid back in the chair. “Did it occur to you I might actually want a
         marshmallow?”</p>
      <p>“It's clear what you want is my attention.” He huffed. “Don’t think Cal isn’t over
         there
         wondering what the hell is up.”</p>
      <p>She peered across the grass but couldn’t make out Caleb’s features in the darkness.
         “Caleb isn’t paying attention.”</p>
      <p>“Well, I am. I’m done, angel. Keep pushing me and I’ll be bad.”</p>
      <p>“Bad? How?”</p>
      <p>“I’ll kiss you, right here. A public declaration. That's what you’ve been wanting
         from
         me. What changed?” James removed his hat. His hair lay plastered to his forehead,
         his
         pupils, endless black holes. “Jaysus, Cassie.” His voice lost its edge. “What do you
         want from me?”</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t matter what I want. You’re not supposed to be in a relationship. It could
         make…you know, make your condition worse.” She told Caleb she wouldn’t tell James
         what
         she knew, but if they were all on the same page, things might be less confusing.</p>
      <p>“My condition?” He tossed the skewer to the ground. “Fuck!”</p>
      <p>If Caleb was awake, he heard that. Emily jerked upright. She scrubbed her eyes.</p>
      <p>James stared toward the swing for a few seconds, then glowered at Cassie. “Define
         my
         condition.”</p>
      <p>“What happened with your parents....” She faltered when his mouth fell open. “You
         know
         what I mean.”</p>
      <p>He brought his hands to his thighs, his fingers balled into fists. “Why does everybody
         around me insist they know what’s best? You’re not in my head. And neither is Cal.”</p>
      <p>Emily wobbled to her feet, teetering too close to the flames. “I want to go home.”</p>
      <p>“Christ.” James tossed his cigarette into the flames then grabbed Emily’s arm. “It’s
         okay, Em. You can sleep in the pool house.”</p>
      <p> He cast a poisonous glare at Cassie. “Your logic is feckin flawed and what you’re
         doing
         isn’t fair to Cal. Besides, go ahead. See if you can ignore me.” </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
