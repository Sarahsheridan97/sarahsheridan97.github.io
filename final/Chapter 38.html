         <h4>Chapter 38</h4>
      </div>
      <p>A stream of sunlight illuminated the empty spot beside James; Cassie vanished—again.
         Raking his fingers through his hair, he organized his thoughts. Last night’s
         recollection of being cut, felt no more real than it did in the shower, but sex with
         Cassie remained deliciously tangible.</p>
      <p>His phone beeped. There were seven text messages, all from Cal, all with the same
         thread
         of concern.</p>
      <p>Where are you?</p>
      <p>Are you okay?</p>
      <p>Call me.</p>
      <p>There were no messages from Cassie explaining her departure. He tossed his phone onto
         the nightstand. It thudded against the lamp.</p>
      <p>“Fuck.” Breaking his phone was the last thing he needed. He leaned over to check it.
         A
         folded piece of paper, a fancy J scrolled across the front, peeked out from under
         the
         lamp base.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for the night,” he read aloud. The night. “What the fuck?” Sure, he said one
         night was all he could give her, but she could at least have woken him up to say
         goodbye.</p>
      <p>He flung the crumpled paper across the room, then dialed Caleb. “What do you effing
         want?”</p>
      <p>Caleb sighed, the type of sigh that accompanies the words thank God, which he didn’t
         have the balls to say. “Guess who’s picture just got released, and is in Woodfield
         Mall;
         at Tuxedo Rose?”</p>
      <p>“Yours?” James asked, work the farthest thing from his mind.</p>
      <p>“No.” Caleb sighed again. “Yours.”</p>
      <p>Groaning, James laid back down, arm over his eyes, and tried to recall something about
         that shoot.</p>
      <p>“You’re sitting on a motorcycle, in a black tux,” Caleb offered a memory prompt. “I
         wanted to give you the heads up. There is no doubt it’s you in the picture. Face and
         tats.”</p>
      <p>“Oh yeah.” A visual of the classic Indian motorbike flashed through James’ head as
         he
         scanned his room. Cassie’s ripped blouse lay on the floor and his shoes were scattered
         by the bathroom door where he kicked them, anxious to continue with his debauchery.</p>
      <p>He touched her pillow and swallowed the lump in his throat. He needed to get out of
         his
         room before he smelt the damn pillow and did the second worst thing possible—call
         her.</p>
      <p>“Let’s go to the mall. I need new shoes and we can make fun of my picture.” He cast
         the
         blanket aside and jumped out of bed en route to the bathroom. The shiny acrylic tub
         sent
         a fresh shiver through him. He had to piss, clean up, and leave the vicinity. Fast.</p>
      <p>Caleb laughed. “You haven't checked your voice messages, have you?”</p>
      <p>“Christ, did you call me too? You’re worse than a chick. I slept in, okay?”</p>
      <p>“Funny, I hardly slept at all,” Caleb said, his voice full of irony. “I'm glad you
         got
         your beauty rest though. When the agency couldn’t reach you, they called me. Lorraine
         wanted to see if we were up for going to the mall… To hang out in front of the
         store.”</p>
      <p>James looked at his phone. Caleb must be slagging him.</p>
      <p>“James, did you hear me? It’s a paid gig.”</p>
      <p>“Seriously, Cal. Live, store models always look like douchebags.”</p>
      <p>Caleb huffed, “I don’t care. I need a diversion.”</p>
      <p>“You want to pick up?” James shoved his bathmat away with his foot. Tactile memories
         of
         last night were too painful with Caleb’s voice in his ear. “What’s wrong? I thought
         we
         talked this through.”</p>
      <p>“We did,” Caleb faltered, “You didn’t crash at the pool house. Did you go after
         her?”</p>
      <p>Goosebumps prickled James’ skin. “Can we discuss this later?”</p>
      <p>“Holy shit, you did.”</p>
      <p>The toilet shifted in and out of James’ focus. His hand jerked to the tank to steady
         himself, but he didn’t remember making it move, and couldn’t feel the cold porcelain
         under his fingers.</p>
      <p>“James. Are you still there?”</p>
      <p>How long had he been staring at the tank? “I'll do the mall thing if you want.”</p>
      <p>“Did you…” Caleb started, then stopped. “Want me to pick you up?”</p>
      <p>James stumbled to the sink. He cranked the cold water to full blast, counting on the
         icy
         temperature to sharpen his focus—and keep him on Earth.</p>
      <p>“James?” Caleb’s voice grew louder, “Do. You. Want. Me. To. Pick. You. Up?”</p>
      <p>“I’ll walk to your house.” Water splashed off James’ fingers and splattered the wall.
         “What if Cassie goes shopping today?”</p>
      <p>Caleb groaned. “Right now, I don't give a shit.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James lit a smoke and watched as Caleb snapped a photo of the section E6, parking
         sign,
         followed by one of the Charger. It was unusual, but he didn’t ask why, and Caleb didn’t
         volunteer the information; or say much of anything on the ride to Schaumburg.</p>
      <p>A short line of girls had formed in the mall’s corridor at the Tuxedo Rose entrance.
         James kept his eyes on the ground as he followed Caleb, into the store.</p>
      <p>A young woman leaned against the counter. “You’re five minutes late.” She thrust dress
         pants, white collared shirts and two pink bowties, at Caleb, then pointed to some
         basic,
         black oxfords. “Put these on. It’s all yours to keep.”</p>
      <p>“Sorry we’re late.” Caleb handed James his portion of the clothes. “Parking issues.”</p>
      <p>The girl’s attention shifted to James. She grinned.</p>
      <p>“What?” James said, wishing he had a joint to smoke.</p>
      <p>“I’m Beth, the event planner for the mall.” She extended her hand, her cheeks red.
         “I
         would have advertised the event differently had I realized I was getting the bag
         model.”</p>
      <p>Lost, James glanced at Caleb, but he appeared confused also.</p>
      <p>Beth disappeared behind the counter. She returned with a handled paper bag featuring
         a
         smaller version of the picture hanging in the store; and on the flip side, a closeup
         of
         James kissing a girl’s cheek.</p>
      <p>Caleb laughed, the first sincere sound out of him all day. “You look good, dude. I
         think
         your pay rate just went up.”</p>
      <p>“Shut up, Cal.” Heat prickled the back of James’ neck.</p>
      <p>Beth handed him the bag, “Can you autograph this please.”</p>
      <p>James scribbled his name, then glared at Caleb. “I'm on the bag. Isn't that
         brilliant?”</p>
      <p>Beth smiled at her bag. “Make sure you sign the release forms by the cash register.
         You
         have to hang out front for at least an hour to get paid. Are you two good?”</p>
      <p>“We’re good,” Caleb said as she walked away. Still chuckling, he turned to James.
         “Chill, dude. I didn’t know about the bag, or that it was an advertised event. Perhaps
         if you spoke to the agency instead of making me your go-between, you’d be better
         informed.”</p>
      <p>James headed to the change rooms. “You owe me. You know I hate being groped.”</p>
      <p>“Really?” Caleb said, from behind, “I could have sworn you were over your touch
         aversion. Besides, I think you owe me.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The chatter in the line of girls grew as they appeared outside the doors. James took
         his
         place. He did owe Cal, and Caleb didn’t know the half of it.</p>
      <p>After ten minutes, the situation grew tedious. James curbed the desire to be rude
         and
         answered question after question about his accent, his tattoos, and his relationship
         status; a question, he noted, they both answered as single. Caleb grinned and chatted.
         A
         girl even penned her number on his shirt sleeve.</p>
      <p>The last four years had been a steady array of girls; an endless sea of faces and
         asses,
         all the same. It held no appeal, anymore. He craved Cassie in a way that consumed
         him, a
         slow burn from the inside out, and it was obvious Caleb didn’t want her the same way.
         He
         couldn’t. Not after Red. Not the way he flirted with these girls. He may like Cassie,
         but he didn’t desire her.</p>
      <p>Somewhere near the end of the hour, the phone flashes blurred, and his body numbed.
         He
         focused on the voices around him so he didn’t stand there like part of the wall, but
         his
         cotton-stuffed head pounded, and he could no longer stop the switch to autopilot.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>On the mezzanine, James leaned forward, his ribs against the hard edge of the food
         court
         table. All around him, tray carrying shoppers chatted, but their garbled voices bubbled
         in as if he were underwater.</p>
      <p>His extremities tingled, but he couldn’t worm himself back into concrete form—or</p>
      <p>get a clear memory of ending the swimsuit ordeal and walking to the restaurant.
         Sometimes it felt like half his life rippled in from another dimension.</p>
      <p>He pushed his plate of noodles away. “Does everywhere we go have to be so crowded?”</p>
      <p>“Eat.” Caleb pushed the plate back. “Jesus. Could you get any narrower?”</p>
      <p>Could he? He’d seen a picture of his real dad once. The man was tall and slim. Angular.
         “Bhi mo dhaid skinny.”</p>
      <p>“Your dad.” Caleb’s expression darkened. “Our dad is flying a plane right now—and
         he's
         not skinny.”</p>
      <p>But his real dad was skinny. Skinny, dark haired—and dead. The fork slipped from his
         grasp. In slow motion, he bent to get it. The food court tilted. Dizzy, he placed
         the
         fork on his plate and laid his palms flat on the table. “Have you talked to the C
         word
         yet?”</p>
      <p>Caleb shoved his plate away. “I don't want to talk about her. She’s doing a number
         on
         your head. Don’t try to pretend you’re not struggling through one of those damn
         episodes. You’re spaced the hell out.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever,” James said, “what are you going to do with those girls’ numbers?”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s expression frosted. He jerked his thumb toward his chest. “Perhaps I need
         an ego
         boost after last night’s discovery. I wish I could take a mental vacation like you.
         Just
         check out whenever I can’t deal with crap.”</p>
      <p>“Fuck you, Cal.” James jumped up. Dissociating wasn’t a vacation. It was disorienting
         and exhausting and used up a lot of mental energy to do the most mundane tasks. All
         facts Caleb was aware of.</p>
      <p>Caleb pinched the bridge of his nose. “Look. We can talk about the C word later. Forget
         about getting shoes, we have plans in half an hour and you need to get some air and
         touch the fucking cement or something.”</p>
      <p>“Plans?”</p>
      <p>“I spent last night on Craigslist.” Caleb gathered their dishes and chinned for James
         to
         follow. “Just remember before you go all moral cop on me and take Cassie’s side in
         this.
         I’m pretty much single right now.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James inhaled smoke from his cigarette. The burn in his lungs, the sun on his back,
         and
         the cool grass under his hands were all part of the real world.</p>
      <p>“You back from Neverland?” Caleb asked as he checked his phone. “We’ve got to roll,
         and
         I need you to be able to function.”</p>
      <p>“I’m a bit less spacey.” James ground out his smoke and flicked the butt at Cal. “Sorry,
         it’s not like I have a lot of control over it.”</p>
      <p>“What triggered that?”</p>
      <p>A shit load of reasons shut him down today, and he stared at the main one. Not that
         he
         could communicate that, or anything, to Caleb right now.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know, man.” Shrugging, he followed Caleb through the maze of cars. “Just
         stressed, I guess.”</p>
      <p>“Stress?” Caleb turned around. “This shit with Cassie has got to end.”</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>A pretty girl in a red tube top perched on the hood of the Charger. Her long black
         hair
         brushed the waistband of her painted-on blue jeans as she slid to the ground.</p>
      <p>Caleb gave the girl an awkward hug. “Hi, Candy. Told you my car would be easy to find.”
         He tossed the keys to James. “I’m in the back. You’re driving.”</p>
      <p>Too surprised to comment, James got in and started the engine. He locked eyes with
         Caleb
         in the rear-view mirror and raised both eyebrows. “Where to?”</p>
      <p>“Liquor Oasis.”</p>
      <p>James shifted into first. This was shaping up to be a long evening.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Half an hour later, James idled behind the beat-up liquor store. The owner jacked
         the
         price but sold them whatever they wanted. His only rule, Caleb did the buying since
         he
         looked older.</p>
      <p>Caleb rounded the corner, carrying a large paper bag. He resumed his position in the
         back and rustled out a six pack of Lime-A-Rita’s and a bottle of Jack Daniels, which
         he
         offered over the seat. “A sip won’t make you blow over.”</p>
      <p>James pushed the bottle away. “You sure you want to drink that? You and whiskey are
         never a clever idea.”</p>
      <p>“I know.” Caleb took a drink, then narrowed his eyes. “You got me tonight?”</p>
      <p>James nodded. “Do you have to ask?”</p>
      <p>“Do I?”</p>
      <p>The outing became clear. It wasn’t about the girl, the Jack, or even about Cassie.
         It
         was about proving allegiance.</p>
      <p>James met Caleb’s questioning gaze. “Ni Neaؘrt go cur le cheؘile,” he said, there
         is no
         strength without unity. A sentiment his stepfather fully believed in.</p>
      <p>Caleb smiled. “Drive around. I need to blow off steam.”</p>
      <p>With no direction in mind, James cranked the music and headed north toward the loop.
         After a while, driving in circles became tedious and the lack of dialogue made his
         lids
         heavy. Yawning, he headed north along Lake Shore Drive. It was getting late, but traffic
         continued to be thick. Something smacked the back of his head. He turned the music
         down.</p>
      <p>“Pull over. I have to piss.” It was the first audible thing Caleb said since they
         left
         the liquor store and his words slurred into each other. “Now,” he added when James
         didn't reply.</p>
      <p>Cursing under his breath, James turned left on the last exit into downtown. Finding
         somewhere to park, with a public bathroom, would be an impossible combination. </p>
      <p>Caleb hit the back of his seat again. “Come on, man.” He sounded like he was in
         pain.</p>
      <p>The girl laughed.</p>
      <p>“I'm looking. Don't get all bent at me because you’re about to piss your pants.” Out
         of
         desperation, he pulled into an underground parking lot.</p>
      <p>Caleb clambered over the seat and pawed the door handle. He spilled out, his shorts
         undone, and staggered to the front of the car.</p>
      <p>Groaning, James flicked the headlights off. He turned toward the back seat. Candy’s
         tube
         top encircled her stomach, the nipples of her breasts peeked through the strands of
         her
         hair. He reached for the bottle. She intercepted his hand and said something in broken
         English.</p>
      <p>He jerked his hand free. “I just want the Jack.”</p>
      <p>The bottle was half empty. There were four Lime-A-Rita's left and Candy appeared sober,
         which meant Caleb consumed a lot of whiskey.</p>
      <p>Caleb appeared at the door and stretched across the back seat. The girl wasted no
         time
         continuing where they left off.</p>
      <p>James swung around but couldn't help flicking his eyes to the mirror. The girl’s head
         dropped below his line of vision. By the sounds of things, she was busy. He twisted
         the
         keys to auxiliary and turned the music up.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A knock on the door jolted James awake. A huge security guard stared down at him.
         James
         pivoted around to check the back seat; Caleb was passed out and alone.</p>
      <p>The security guard tapped his ear and James turned the music down.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, sir,” he said, through the two inches of open window. “We're leaving now.”
         He
         put the charger in reverse and drove away before the man could reply.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James parked the Charger inside Caleb’s garage so Elizabeth wouldn’t see them. Neither
         would Cassie if she happened to look out her window. He got out and slid the front
         seat
         forward, as far as it could go. “We're home, Callie.”</p>
      <p>Caleb gripped the back of the seat and righted himself; head hanging, shirt wet, like
         he
         burped up nothing but alcohol. He looked up but his eyes remained unfocused.</p>
      <p>“Come on,” James pleaded, “try to walk. I have a harder time dragging your drunk arse
         around, than you have when you’re watching me.”</p>
      <p>Groaning, Caleb stumbled out the door. He pitched headfirst toward the cement.</p>
      <p>“Jaysus.” James grabbed Caleb’s arm. “I hate to see you like this.”</p>
      <p>“Like what? Like you; boy wonder,” Caleb muttered as James dragged him across the
         grass,
         “you can do anything you want, and it never fucking matters.”</p>
      <p>“Hush.” Ignoring the words, James focused on getting Caleb past the flat screen without
         knocking it over. “You’re as battered as I’ve ever seen you.” He dumped Caleb onto
         the
         sofa and clicked on the light.</p>
      <p>Caleb covered his eyes. “Turn it off. Too fucking bright.”</p>
      <p>“I Can’t. You’re a mess.” He pulled Caleb’s shirt off and emptied his pockets. After
         setting the puke bucket beside the sofa, he sunk onto the chair, lit a smoke, and
         pulled
         out his phone.</p>
      <p>There were a couple messages from Alexa, and three from Mary, who must be daft because
         he never replied to anything she sent.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s phone vibrated from the coffee table. James stared at it a few minutes, then
         reached for it. The thought he’d been reduced to sneaking peeks at Caleb’s messages
         made
         him cringe, but he turned it on, anyway.</p>
      <p>A password request came up. On a whim, he typed in Cassie’s name. The screen remained
         locked. Cheeks puffed, he entered, Mozart, the name of Caleb’s only dog. Cal was crazy
         about that dog, but Elizabeth decided the large black lab required too much effort
         and,
         a month after James came to live with them, Mozart disappeared.</p>
      <p>The screen lit up. There were ten texts from Cassie. Ten messages not meant for his
         eyes.</p>
      <p>His heart pounded in his ears as he made sense of Cassie’s words. She was sorry. She
         missed Caleb. She really liked him. James scanned the rest. They were similar in
         content, the recurring theme being, she wanted Caleb and only Caleb. The last one
         claimed, Sometimes James scares me.</p>
      <p>What did he expect? She dropped all sorts of hints, asking what his intentions were,
         and
         all he could offer was one night. Then he wigged out in front of her, and worse,
         confessed to being burnt by cigarettes. No wonder she left.</p>
      <p>He whipped Caleb’s phone against the wall; the shattering sound, proof Cal would never
         read those texts. He stripped to his underwear and wrapped a blanket around himself.
         His
         phone tucked in the cushion. Out of eyesight before he threw it too. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
