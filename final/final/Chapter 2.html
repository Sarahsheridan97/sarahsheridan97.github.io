         <h4>Chapter 2</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Cassie lifted the heavy drapery from the corner of her second-floor bedroom window.
         Her
         new neighbor Caleb swam every morning, and his backstroke was the best reason to wake
         up—ever.</p>
      <p>Her father was right. A change of scenery might be good for her.</p>
      <p>Caleb disappeared behind the tall, wooden fence, concealing half the pool. He emerged
         seconds later, mid butterfly stroke. His arms sliced the water; powerful movements
         that
         showed off great form. He had to be on the swim team. The sport she excelled in before
         she dropped out of senior year mid-winter—and out of existence.</p>
      <p>Three weeks in her creepy new home and so far, the only friend she made was Allison,
         a
         girl she met in summer school. Not the successful starting over her father wished
         for.</p>
      <p>Caleb seems nice, her dad said, the third time Caleb stopped by to invite her to swim.
         Not all boys are like Paul.</p>
      <p>Then her dad’s new job started, and he left on a long-haul flight. The opportunity
         to
         fly an Airbus A380 was the official reason her father moved his family from Kansas—not
         just to get her out of the school district. Her mom, a flight attendant, would leave
         tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Her mom’s absence was never a bad thing, but it did mean she would be abandoned in
         the
         huge, old house—and being alone for days was well, lonely.</p>
      <p>Cassie let the curtain fall into place. So far, her journal entries read, Unpacking
         sucks… My new neighbor is cute… Yep, summer school… and… Help. I need a life. Outside
         of
         the skinny dipper she witnessed yesterday, a wild blur of dark hair and tattooed skin
         that sprang from Caleb’s tiny yellow guest house, her journal contained boring entries
         to reflect her empty world.</p>
      <p>She couldn’t tell if Caleb was trustworthy, but according to Instagram, he was a party
         boy with a huge following.</p>
      <p>A perfect contact for meeting people before school started.</p>
      <p>Her dad didn’t know the whole story—what happened with Paul was her fault and she
         deserved the fallout—but he did have something right. She needed to move past it,
         meet
         new people and get a life.</p>
      <p>She didn’t need her dad, his voice hushed, talking to her as if she were an injured
         animal. And she definitely didn’t need her mother. She needed a boyfriend, one she
         wanted to lose her virginity to. One who lived close by, available if she required
         him.</p>
      <p>Caleb would be perfect.</p>
      <p>A small cardboard box labeled Swim sat on the corner of her desk; the only box she
         hadn’t unpacked. She dumped its contents. Last summer’s pink bikini lay on top of
         her
         ragged collection of Blue Valley High’s black and gold swimsuits. The bikini fit better
         this year, snug where it should be, no gaps.</p>
      <p>She pulled on a worn pair of denim shorts, then tossed the team suits into the garbage.
         Goodbye, Blue Valley. Goodbye, Kansas. Goodbye, Paul.</p>
      <p>Hello new existence.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>To avoid her mother, Cassie descended the narrow, rear stairway to the kitchen, then
         slipped into the backyard. She followed the fence until it ended, then padded across
         the
         strip of grass to Caleb’s garage. Their wooden gate banged shut behind her; loud enough
         to inform Caleb and half the neighborhood, of her arrival.</p>
      <p>The tight stone pathway, squeezed in between the fence and garage, ended in interlocking
         pavers fifteen-odd feet from the pool. There was no sign of Caleb, but the water’s
         cool
         blue ripples lured her forward.</p>
      <p>She maneuvered around a swing, between cushy lounge chairs and past potted ferns.
         The
         view from her window didn’t do his landscape justice. Across the narrow yard,
         sweet-scented, purple flowers hung from a vined pergola, and four colored Adirondack
         chairs surrounded a small firepit. The guest house that housed the streaker, looked
         cozy
         from the ground.</p>
      <p>She reached the pool, toes on the curved rim, and bent to test the water. Caleb broke
         through the surface at her feet.</p>
      <p>Gasping, she jumped back and clutched her chest.</p>
      <p>“Holy fuck!” Caleb’s eyes were wide. “You scared the shit out of me. What are you
         doing
         here?”</p>
      <p>“You said I should come swim… anytime… remember?” He sounded annoyed. Not at all like
         the friendly guy who invited her over.</p>
      <p>Brows furrowed, he glanced toward the yellow house, then sunk under the water. When
         he
         emerged, he smiled. “Sorry. I had a late night and a rough morning. Can we start
         over?”</p>
      <p>“Sure.” Her bikini strap slid off her shoulder as she lowered herself onto the pavers,
         but Caleb’s attention was once again on the small building in the rear of his yard.
         She
         eyed its lavender door as goosebumps pricked her arms. “Are we alone?”</p>
      <p>Caleb pulled himself out to sit beside her, his red spandex suit a second skin. “My
         friend likes to sleep in our pool house, but if we weren’t alone, we’d have company
         by
         now.” He flicked water at her. “I’m glad you came over. I thought I’d offended you
         somehow.”</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t resist the pool this morning.” What else could she say? It would help
         if he
         stopped staring at her. “Are your parents’ home?” Dang. That sounded like a proposition.
         She crossed her arms. “Does everyone around here fly. I mean work at
         Midway…Airport?”</p>
      <p>Caleb blinked, then stretched out, legs in the pool, elbows on the pavers. “My dad’s
         a
         pilot, but my family is involved with The University of Chicago. My mom quit teaching
         when…when I was ten.” He motioned to the top section of a brick house peeking over
         the
         tall pickets of the fence. “My friend Ron lives over there. Both his parents are
         lawyers. He's kind of an ass-hat, but he's here a lot.”</p>
      <p>“I saw him yesterday,” she admitted, “skinny dipping.”</p>
      <p>Caleb lurched upright, full attention on her. “I wouldn’t let Ron’s bare ass near
         my
         pool, especially if I was in it.”</p>
      <p>“I was in my bedroom and I…” She should have kept her mouth shut.</p>
      <p>He turned toward her house. “And your bedroom is?”</p>
      <p>“Over there.” She offered a weak gesture to the gabled, double set of windows she
         knew
         to be hers. “Second floor, far end. I can only see half your yard…not that I’m
         creeping.”</p>
      <p>“Wow,” he said after a few seconds. “We must have given old Mrs. Watkins quite a show
         when she lived in your house.”</p>
      <p>Cassie grinned. If old Mrs. Watkins got yesterday’s view, she would have had a heart
         attack. “If that wasn’t Ron, who was it?”</p>
      <p>“That would be James.” Creases appeared in Caleb’s forehead. “He used to live here.
         You'll meet him too. Eventually.”</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t sound like you like him much.”</p>
      <p>Caleb slid into the water and kicked off the side, seamlessly perfecting a dead man’s
         float. His hair, a blond halo, shimmered in the ripples. After a few seconds, he got
         his
         footing, sending droplets of water through the air.</p>
      <p>“I love the dude like a brother, but he has issues. I'm coming to get you.” He dove
         under, his body a shadow heading toward her. She yanked her feet out of the water
         just
         as he reached them.</p>
      <p>“You told me you could swim,” he said when he popped up. He grinned. “You're not afraid
         of me, are you?”</p>
      <p>She was. Residual fear leftover from Paul, but she would never admit it out loud,
         and
         planned to get over it. She stepped out of her shorts and headed past the low dive,
         to
         the high springboard.</p>
      <p>“Most private pools don’t have boards this high,” she said from the top.</p>
      <p>“My parents splurged. They insist if I practice enough, I’ll get a scholarship. But
         truthfully, I prefer swimming over diving.”</p>
      <p>She stopped mid-board. Diving in a bikini could be risky. Did she want to end up
         bottomless in his pool? She wanted to flirt, not look desperate.</p>
      <p>“You look pretty hot up there.” He waited alongside the edge. “Show me what you
         got.”</p>
      <p>She counted three steps, bounced once, and did a one and a half, forward flip, slicing
         the surface. Her execution wasn’t perfect, but good enough. She rose in the shallow
         end
         to applause.</p>
      <p>“The country girl has skills.”</p>
      <p>She could kill her mother for informing everybody they were from Kansas. “How come
         everyone in the city thinks you're a hick if you come from a small town?”</p>
      <p>“I don't think you're a hick.” Caleb disappeared under the water and closed the distance
         between them. He surfaced inches away. “In fact, I think my summer just got a lot
         more
         interesting.”</p>
      <p>“Because of me?” She could play this game.</p>
      <p>Droplets of water clumped his dark lashes and accented sky-blue eyes. Not a blemish
         or
         freckle marred his face. She was in over her head and half expected him to say just
         kidding.</p>
      <p>He tilted his head. “Do you have a boyfriend missing you like crazy back home?”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t date much.”</p>
      <p>“How come?”</p>
      <p>“Both my parents fly all the time. They stuck me with a nanny until my sixteenth
         birthday. I’ve never had a boyfriend that…” She bit her bottom lip. Information about
         Paul needed to stay buried. “What about you?”</p>
      <p>He climbed the steps and headed toward the pool house. “What do you want to know?”</p>
      <p>“Hmm. Let me think.” She followed but stopped short when they reached the entrance.
         Last
         time she was alone with a guy, she ended up in the hospital.</p>
      <p>Caleb waited in the open doorway. “I’m not an axe murderer. Leave the door open if
         you
         want.”</p>
      <p>With a deep breath, she crossed the threshold—and shut the door. Playing it safe ruined
         her life in Kansas. That wouldn’t happen again.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Make yourself at home.” Caleb paused in front of a wide archway that housed a tiny
         kitchenette. “I need a quick shower, or my hair will turn green. Give me two
         minutes.”</p>
      <p>Unable to sit in her wet swimsuit, she hovered by the door. The backside of a large
         TV
         blocked her view. After a minute, she inched around it.</p>
      <p>Mismatched chairs flanked an overstuffed sofa and surrounded a wooden coffee table,
         making the area cramped or cozy, depending on the company. The only other door, directly
         across from the bathroom, was partly open, a bedpost visible. Against the back wall,
         a
         collection of musical instruments surrounded an upright piano. She stepped closer
         to
         investigate. The bathroom door opened.</p>
      <p>Caleb cleared his throat. He’d changed into board shorts, a bright orange polo, and
         held
         two yellow towels. He draped one over his shoulders then handed her the other.</p>
      <p>“Come up with any questions?” he asked, as he plunked onto the sofa.</p>
      <p>After wrapping the towel around her hips, she sat on a chair. “Do you have a girlfriend
         who might be unhappy with me being here?” That would put a hitch in her plans.</p>
      <p>“I’m offended.” He laid his hand across his heart. “I wouldn't have invited you over
         if
         I did.”</p>
      <p>“But you’re cute. You must have girls all over you.”</p>
      <p>“Cute.” A rosy hue climbed his neck. “Like a puppy?”</p>
      <p>“Is there something wrong with that word?”</p>
      <p>He pulled one side of his mouth into a crooked smile. “I’m red, aren’t I? My friend
         would love to witness this.”</p>
      <p>“The ass-hat or the streaker?”</p>
      <p>His smile faded. “The streaker. Hey, I'm getting hungry. Why don't you go home and
         change? Let me take you out for lunch.”</p>
      <p>“Sure,” she said. This was easier than she thought. For the first time in a year,
         she
         relaxed.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>The wooden screen door banged shut behind James as he entered Caleb’s kitchen. Wincing,
         he covered his ears. Last night had been a blast, at least what he could remember
         of it,
         but this morning was brutal.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s mom leaned against the counter as she rifled through a stack of index cards.
         She
         looked up, leaving him no choice but to stumble to the center island under her scrutiny.
         He sat on a stool and rested his forehead on the cool marble.</p>
      <p>“You look terrible,” she said, as her slippers appeared in his line of vision.</p>
      <p>He lifted his head.</p>
      <p>Before he could protest, she pressed her cool hand against his forehead. “You don’t
         feel
         hot.”</p>
      <p>He feigned a cough, hoping to appear sick, but being dishonest to Elizabeth sucked.
         Not
         having to lie to her was one of the reasons he moved into his own apartment.</p>
      <p>“Did Cal look sick this morning?” He lost track of Caleb sometime after midnight,
         but he
         couldn’t look much better. “Maybe we have the same thing.”</p>
      <p>The creases in Elizabeth’s forehead deepened, the same way Cal’s did when something
         upset him. “I worry about you, James.”</p>
      <p>Grateful as he was to Caleb’s mom for filling in where his own mother failed, he
         couldn’t do emotion with her. It seemed like a breach of loyalty, somehow. He focused
         on
         the fridge, but she stepped in front of him. A tactical move, that according to Dr.
         Madison, would force him to see her. Today it worked and he met her eyes.</p>
      <p>She rested her hand on his arm. “Stay healthy, please?”</p>
      <p>Not stiffening required energy he didn’t have. He hated hurting her, but his shoulders
         tensed.</p>
      <p>She retreated to the counter. “You just missed Cal.”</p>
      <p>“Missed him? Where did he go?”</p>
      <p>“Out with our new neighbor, Cassie. Lunch, I believe.”</p>
      <p>“Lunch? He took her on a date? In the daytime?” That seemed serious—and out of
         character. For the first time Caleb’s words about wanting a girlfriend pulled some
         weight.</p>
      <p>James yanked his phone from his back pocket. There were no messages from Caleb, asking
         if he got home safe. None.</p>
      <p>He scrolled to Caleb’s name. Enough shite, he typed, I want to meet up with you and
         Cassie.</p>
      <p>Screw his agreement to stay away.</p>
      <p>“Is something wrong?” Elizabeth asked from the end of the counter.</p>
      <p>“Cal left without checking on me.” Shit. Saying what he felt broke his standard
         practice. Especially when what he felt sounded pathetic. His brain must still be soaked
         in alcohol.</p>
      <p>A sad smile flickered across Elizabeth’s lips. “I'm sure he didn't forget about you.”
         She pushed a cup of coffee toward him. “I like Cassie. She seems more grounded than
         the
         girls you meet through modeling.”</p>
      <p>It was the standard lecture, and she’d given it multiple times, ever since they gave
         up
         high school girls. He sipped his coffee. At least she lost the poor baby expression.</p>
      <p>She set a small container of cream on the counter. “Sitting here in dirty pants and
         a
         wrinkly T-shirt, it’s hard to imagine you're the same person in those photos. Some
         of it
         is too risque. It reminds me of pornography.”</p>
      <p>Pornography. The word sounded extra dirty coming out of her mouth; and was off the
         table
         for morning conversation. Coffee splashed over the rim as he plunked his cup down.</p>
      <p>“Mom. Le do thoil.” The equivalent of, Mom, please.</p>
      <p>“You know I didn’t learn Irish like your brother did.” She poured a small amount of
         cream into her cup. “Why don't you go upstairs and take a hot bath? Go lay down in
         the
         guest room and...”</p>
      <p>The guest room had been his bedroom, but he never lasted an entire night in it. He
         ended
         up in Caleb’s room so often, Caleb’s father put a mattress on the floor. Cal never
         seem
         to mind the intrusion. They would spend hours talking, half English, half Irish, all
         nonsense. Not being alone at night was what he missed most when he moved.</p>
      <p>The muscles in his stomach clenched. There had been plenty of times he wished Cal
         would
         lighten up and get off his tail, but now that he had, the abandonment stung.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth stared at him from across the block. Had she said something else? Not cool.
         She was the last person he wanted to zone out in front of.</p>
      <p>“Jacuzzi… James...Why don’t you go soak in the tub then lay down for a while.” She
         retrieved his extra bottle of anti-anxiety meds from the cupboard above the sink and
         shook one into her palm. With an encouraging smile, she extended her hand. “Just take
         it
         and go clean up.”</p>
      <p>Unlike his real mother, Caleb’s mom proved trustworthy. He swallowed the pill with
         the
         rest of his coffee then reached for an apple from the fruit bowl. “Wake me up by noon,
         please.” He took a bite. “I have this casting thing. To walk in fall fashion week.”</p>
      <p>“Today?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah.” He stopped chewing. “What?”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth shook her head. “I realize the state views you as an adult, but if I had
         any
         say in it, I would insist you call in sick. This is exactly why I disagreed with your
         emancipation. Seventeen is too young to be on your own. You look terrible.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t worry.” He tried not to smile. “It's not my face they're interested in.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth’s mouth dropped open.</p>
      <p>“I’m teasing,” he said. “Shit, Cal would kill me if I did that.”</p>
      <p>Not that it mattered. After sending that text, Caleb would kill him, anyway.</p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
