         <h4>Chapter 9</h4>
      </div>
      <p>The pink eastern sky illumed Caleb’s backyard in predawn dewiness. “Ron’s gone,” Cassie
         noted, surveying the spot where he laid.</p>
      <p>“I noticed.” James held the pool house door open. “Let’s hope he crawled home and
         not in
         here.”</p>
      <p>She tried to unravel James’ ‘I hope Ron went home’ subtext. But everything about James
         required mental energy and she was exhausted after spending an evening with him. She
         crossed the threshold and plopped onto her favorite chair.</p>
      <p>“Caleb claims you guys can play all these instruments,” she said to break the silence,
         “not just the guitars,”</p>
      <p>“Most of them.”</p>
      <p>“Just like that, huh?”</p>
      <p>“Pretty much. It's how Cal and I met.”</p>
      <p>Eyes closed, she imagined them as little kids performing in black suits and crisp
         red
         ties. The vision dissolved into them whacking each other with drum sticks.</p>
      <p>“Hey, wake up.”</p>
      <p>She jumped at the sound of James’ voice. Half his shirt buttons were undone. “Don't
         puss
         out on me yet.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not. Caleb said you can sing. Play me a song.”</p>
      <p>James pressed his lips together but picked up one of the guitars. He sat on the sofa
         and
         strummed, then stopped to tune the strings. “What else did Caleb say about me?”</p>
      <p>“Just what you said. That you met in some study.”</p>
      <p>Nodding, he retrieved a black guitar pick from the end table’s drawer. Head down,
         he
         began a song. Melancholy lyrics matched a hunting tempo.</p>
      <p>“Who’s that? It’s pretty,” she asked when the music paused.</p>
      <p>“I wrote it.” A bashful smile crept across his face. “Haven’t even played it for Cal
         yet.”</p>
      <p>He continued, each note filling her with delicious warmth. She leaned forward and
         a
         bright shade of red colored his cheeks. He laid the guitar down so fast she laughed.</p>
      <p>“You're cute when you blush.”</p>
      <p>“I look daft when I blush.” He shook his hair out and leaned back. “You're falling
         asleep. A swim would wake you up.”</p>
      <p>A yawn slipped from her mouth before she could stifle it. “It's morning. Maybe I want
         to
         sleep. Besides, I don't have a suit, and I'm not skinny-dipping. Just throwing that
         out
         there.”</p>
      <p>“Nonsense. If you wanted to sleep, you'd have gone home.” He knelt next to her chair;
         elbows planted on the arm. “What makes you think I would rip off my clothing and skinny
         dip with you? What do you think about me, Cassie?”</p>
      <p>Her breath caught, but she wrinkled her nose. “Well, you're such a man whore, at this
         point, I'm assuming everyone has seen you naked.</p>
      <p>“Shows how much you know. I’ve been with lots of girls, but none of them have seen
         all
         of me, or touched all of me, for that matter. Understand?” He motioned downward with
         his
         eyes.</p>
      <p>Her vision followed, to where the material of his jeans covered what he referenced.
         She
         jerked her head up. “How is that possible?”</p>
      <p>“There are such things as blankets and darkness.” Brows cocked, he added. “Plus, the
         words ‘don't feckin touch me,’ go a long way.”</p>
      <p>“You're kidding, right?” She was warned James was messed up, but he had to be teasing.
         “I would never have sex with a guy who wouldn't let me touch him. That’s insulting.”</p>
      <p>“Girls can touch me, just not in places that are off-limits. Besides, they forget
         about
         touching me soon enough.” His gaze drifted to her lips.</p>
      <p>“I would still want to touch you…Well, not you,” she sputtered, “whomever.” She rubbed
         her palms together. “Sex is all about touching and exploring. What good is it to be
         physically close to someone, but not let them get close to you. You know, let them
         in?”</p>
      <p>“Oh, they let me in. And, just so you know, sex for a guy is about working out their
         frustrations so you don’t punch somebody. You better get those crazy ideals of love
         out
         of your head or you're going to get hurt.”</p>
      <p>“I meant letting someone in here.” She placed her hand over his heart, the warmth
         of his
         skin joined the heat of her fingers.</p>
      <p>His heartbeat pounded, in tune with her own. His breathing hitched. He bit his bottom
         lip, but when she lifted her gaze to meet his, his eyes narrowed. She couldn't read
         his
         expression.</p>
      <p>She looked away. “So, what about that swim?”</p>
      <p>“You don’t have a suit, remember?” He stood and stretched, his gaze on her,
         calculating.</p>
      <p>She shrugged. If he wanted her in the pool, he needed to figure out how to make it
         happen.</p>
      <p>“I'll tell you what. I'll swim in my cacks if you do,” he spit the offer out, then
         snickered. “I don't want you in my cacks.” He squeezed his eyes shut. “Shite. You
         know
         what I mean. Swim in your bra and panties. It's like a bathing suit, right?”</p>
      <p>For some reason, the idea seemed plausible.</p>
      <p>“What if Caleb looks out the window?” she said, “he hasn't seen me in my underwear
         yet.”</p>
      <p>“Are you kidding me? He’s out till at least noon.” James unbuttoned the rest of his
         shirt and the garment slipped to the floor. “Besides. It’s just a swim.”</p>
      <p>She had worn bikinis more revealing, but never at sunrise, alone with a guy. One that
         revved her pulse. One that was off-limits.</p>
      <p>“What do you care?” She got out of the chair, her eyes on his waistband. “I already
         saw
         you in underwear. Besides you’re a guy, you have nothing to hide.”</p>
      <p>“That's rather presumptuous. You don't know anything about me. I may be hiding all
         sorts
         of stuff.” He undid the top two buttons on his button fly jeans. “At the count of
         three,
         I'm dropping my drawers.”</p>
      <p>The patch of gray underwear visible through his half-opened fly looked innocuous enough,
         and in her heart, she knew he wouldn’t hurt her.</p>
      <p>“Okay.” She stepped closer.</p>
      <p>In one determined motion, she yanked her shirt off and tossed it on top of his. He
         had
         the decency to keep his eyes on hers, not on her chest. She undid her pants.</p>
      <p>He blinked. “On the count of three, we ditch the bottoms. One, two—you’re not going
         to
         bail and leave me lookin an ejit?”</p>
      <p>“Do you trust me?” she asked.</p>
      <p>He nodded. “Three.”</p>
      <p>He stepped out of his pants. She did the same. His amazed expression made any
         embarrassment worth it.</p>
      <p>“Brilliant. I can't believe you did it.” He fiddled with a pen on the end table.</p>
      <p>It may have been an attempt to be polite and not ogle her, but his befuddled awkwardness
         made her feel more exposed than any jokes or lewd comments would have.</p>
      <p>“I'm out of here,” he said, his voice husky. He left the door open and flipped straight
         into the pool.</p>
      <p>She dove off the side into the deep end, then climbed the ladder to dive off the board.
         Surfacing, she swam toward him, but he made a game of not letting her get close.</p>
      <p>“Stay still.” She pulled herself out to sit on the ledge and wrang out her hair. “What
         is wrong with you? I don't want to play tag. I want to talk without having to yell
         and
         wake everyone up.”</p>
      <p>“We've talked enough, angel,” he said from ten feet away. “You look tired. You should
         go
         to bed now.”</p>
      <p>“Swimming was your idea.”</p>
      <p>“And now it’s not.” He grimaced. “You might as well not be wearing that bra.”</p>
      <p>No longer embarrassed, she hoisted the straps of her brassiere. He’d hardly glanced
         at
         her, not that she expected him to. It was clear he saw enough female anatomy.</p>
      <p>With a groan, he slipped under the water. She flagged his attention the next time
         he
         surfaced. “I’m going.” She pointed to the pool house. “Can I sleep in there?”</p>
      <p>“Why?”</p>
      <p>“No one’s home and I hate sleeping in my house alone. It’s old and scary.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever.” He stared at the sky. “Take the bed. I’ll sleep on the couch.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The track pants James loaned her were where she left them, slung across the chair.
         She
         pulled a T from the top drawer and laid on top of the comforter, under an oversized
         knit
         throw.</p>
      <p>In a few hours, her parents would be back, and she wanted to beat them home. Not that
         they would notice her absence, or that she had anything to hide. Other than harmless
         flirting, James clearly wasn’t interested.</p>
      <p>Images of him floated behind her eyes. The way he peered through his hair when he
         wanted
         to hide, the warmth of his body behind hers. He’d held her hand in the restaurant.
         It
         may have been more protective than provocative, but hardly the action of someone who
         disliked her so openly the last few weeks.</p>
      <p>The front door opened then shut. Steps faded into the bathroom. She drifted off until
         the creaking floor warned her someone entered the room.</p>
      <p>James stood beside the bed. He wore pajama pants, a towel around his neck.</p>
      <p>“Looking for my pillow.” He backed away.</p>
      <p>Half asleep, she moved over. “Lay beside me. I don't want to be alone.”</p>
      <p>It was a lie, to herself and to him, but she didn’t care. He made her feel safe and
         she
         was lonely.</p>
      <p>“Angel,” he began, sounding unsure and un-James, “I’ve been behaving bad enough, but
         that’s pushing it.”</p>
      <p>“It's just sleeping.” She closed her eyes. “You stayed with me the other night and
         nothing happened…” Her thoughts unraveled, and she was asleep.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James hovered by the bed. She was mistaken. He’d buggered off within five minutes
         of her
         falling asleep—before the idea of intimacy short-circuited his system. He spent that
         night on the sofa.</p>
      <p>“Cassie?” he asked, “you awake?” Going into the bedroom had been an asinine move.
         One he
         had no business doing. Still, he couldn’t help himself.</p>
      <p>“Hmmm.” Her eyelids flickered, then she stilled, her breathing deepened.</p>
      <p>“I don't sleep with chicks. I sleep with chicks,” he said. A futile declaration because
         she was comatose, and the lure was too strong to make himself walk away.</p>
      <p>He crawled in beside her and laid on his back. Horrible scenarios played through his
         head. All of which ended in Caleb hating him and Elizabeth rebuking him. There were
         no
         outcomes that didn’t spell disaster.</p>
      <p>Cassie twisted into him—a move he hadn’t considered. He automatically adjusted so
         her
         head lay in the crook of his arm. Jaysus, he was in a bed, cuddling his brother’s
         girlfriend. A tingle shot up his spine. His heart pounded, his stomach flipped and
         before he could stop it, his body melted into the bedding.</p>
      <p>Cassie curled around him, yet he couldn’t feel the weight of her head, the dampness
         of
         her hair, or the heat of her skin against his ribs. She draped an arm over his chest
         and
         fisted the blanket, anchoring herself in place.</p>
      <p>“I can't be what you need.” He muttered the words, unsure if audible sound came out.
         You’re dissociating, warned a tiny voice from somewhere in the back of his head. Find
         something to ground yourself. He needed something solid, something to pull him back.</p>
      <p>He inched his hand toward Cassie’s. When he finally held it, he ran his thumb over
         her
         skin. He could fit her whole hand under his. He concentrated on being mindfully present.
         Next to Cassie. The way his hip sunk into the mattress. The way she curved against
         him.
         Time trickled by, until he could hear his breaths hungry for oxygen, and feel his
         heart,
         working hard.</p>
      <p>“Ground yourself,” he said and this time he heard his voice.</p>
      <p>He entwined his fingers with Cassie’s and nestled his cheek against her head. The
         faint
         hint of green apples lingered under the smell of chlorine, and just like that, he
         was
         back in his body.</p>
      <p>Sleeping beside someone existed outside of his comfort zone—and always ended in
         disaster. But here he was, one hundred percent present, enjoying Cassie’s slight weight
         and warm presence against his skin.</p>
      <p>He snaked his other arm around her and rubbed gentle circles against her side, a
         soothing repetitive motion.</p>
      <p>Cassie was solid. She could keep him grounded. </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
