         <h4>Chapter 25</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Not wanting to wait inside Alexa's Prius while she fussed with makeup, James leaned
         against the back door and lit a cigarette. Even from half a block away, the faint
         sound
         of dance music reached him. Pulling the smoke deep into his lungs, he stared down
         the
         street toward his childhood home, a block away from the party.</p>
      <p>The neighborhood looked the same. The houses on the east side had backyards facing
         the
         lake, but were worth the same as the houses on the west side, although the taxes were
         higher. A bone of contention with his stepfather.</p>
      <p>Without looking in his direction, Alexa slammed the driver door and headed toward
         the
         party. Snickering, he enjoyed her rear view as she struggled over the asphalt. She
         picked one hell of a night to wear four-inch heels, but her ass looked hot in her
         tight,
         red mini skirt.</p>
      <p>She turned to glare at him. “Look at all these cars. This is a huge party.”</p>
      <p>He shrugged but couldn't hide his grin. To discourage her from coming, he insisted
         the
         party would be a small, high school thing, and now she was pissed. Pity for her. He
         didn’t give a rat’s ass how angry she was. Thanks to her stash of weed, there wasn’t
         much he cared about. Not even his location.</p>
      <p>He jammed his hands into his pockets and found the extra joints he rolled while Alexa
         showered. At some point tonight Cassie would show, and float into Cal’s waiting arms.
         The scene would be easier to tolerate, stoned.</p>
      <p>Alexa waited for him a few cars down. “Don’t give me that stupid smile of yours.”</p>
      <p>“I swear, no one told me it was this big of an event.” Chuckling, he passed her. With
         any luck, he would lose her in the crowd.</p>
      <p>The party was on the east side of the street. A heavy urn filled with umbrellas and
         a
         couple of lacrosse sticks propped the front door open. Inside, the party was in full
         swing.</p>
      <p>James veered left from the tiled foyer, through open pocket doors. He inched his way
         along the crowded living room; Alexa close behind. Tall, French doors dominated the
         back
         wall and allowed a hind view of the disc jockey as he waved his hands in the air,
         pumping up the crowd.</p>
      <p>James stopped to watch. For a few seconds Alexa shimmied to the beat, then she tugged
         him under a wide arch where a long, dining room table was pushed against another set
         of
         doors. Outside, on the deck, the crowd cheered with the D.J.</p>
      <p>A second archway led to the kitchen. Here, the deck was less crowded, and the lake
         loomed, a mammoth black mass in the distance. Its shoreline of lime grass and rushes
         were the perfect place for a child to hide. The thought made him shiver.</p>
      <p>He turned from the doors and scanned the kitchen for alcohol. Sure enough, two kegs
         were
         set up in the corner. He nudged Alexa. “Beer?”</p>
      <p>The stack of red cups had dwindled down to a single, open package. He filled two of
         them
         and handed her one. “Need anything else?”</p>
      <p>“Going somewhere?” she asked.</p>
      <p>“I left my phone in your car. If you’re okay, I’ll go get it.”</p>
      <p>With a sigh, she dropped her keys into his outstretched hand. “Don’t take off.”</p>
      <p>She had nothing to worry about. He would rather be flogged than be seen driving a
         Prius.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>After burning a joint, he returned to the living room where a group of girls showed
         off
         their dance moves, none of whom he wanted to converse with. He jerked his hood up
         as his
         phone vibrated against his spine, where he stashed it under his waistband.</p>
      <p>Hey, bro. Caleb sent. Can’t meet you. Getting lucky with Red.</p>
      <p>Going to this party was Caleb’s idea. Where did that leave Cassie? Where did that
         leave
         him?</p>
      <p>Isn’t Cassie meeting you—here? He typed.</p>
      <p>Told her something came up. She won't show without me.</p>
      <p>James jammed his phone into his pocket. If it were up to him, he would tell Cassie
         the
         truth. Lying may have bought him some time from Alexa just now, but serious deception
         never got him anywhere. He lied to protect his mom. Boldfaced lies to his teachers,
         the
         judge and to himself. He lied until he couldn’t tell the facts from fiction, and it
         didn’t matter anymore.</p>
      <p>After draining his cup, he merged into foot traffic. He got as far as the kitchen
         archway.</p>
      <p>“Hi, James, having a good summer?” Allison Ziegler blocked his way, her hands on her
         hips. She was one of Caleb’s exes. If she wanted to talk to Cal, she needed to pick
         a
         number.</p>
      <p>“Sure. You?” He tried to inch around her.</p>
      <p>She huffed, “Horrible. I’m stuck in summer school. Is Caleb with you?”</p>
      <p>“He’s out with some ride.” He tried to pass her again.</p>
      <p>“That’s interesting. I’m here with this girl I met in class. She claims she’s dating
         him.”</p>
      <p>He stopped trying to evade her.</p>
      <p>“I think she has the wrong guy because when I tried to clarify—Caleb, tall, blond,
         model, she had no idea what I was talking about. She’s refused to send me a picture,
         so
         I don’t believe her, but figured I’d see for myself tonight.”</p>
      <p>“What’s your friend’s name?” He held his breath.</p>
      <p>“Cassie Overfield.” She pointed into the kitchen. “Look. She’s over there.”</p>
      <p>The mass of people in the kitchen parted as if on cue. Cassie stood in the middle,
         under
         the glowing row of fluorescent track lighting, fairer and more delicate than he cared
         to
         remember.</p>
      <p>Allison punched his shoulder. “Do you know her?”</p>
      <p>Cassie looked around, probably searching for Caleb. Caleb, who dumped her. In slow
         motion, she twisted toward them.</p>
      <p>James dragged Allison around the other side of the column.</p>
      <p>“Oh—Cassie,” he said, “she, uh. She moved into the empty house beside Cal's this
         summer.”</p>
      <p>“So, they're together?” Allison looked at him like he’d lost it.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure what's going on.” He wasn’t lying. “But Cal’s not showing up here.”
         Also,
         the truth.</p>
      <p>She grimaced. “I know what you mean by ride, James.”</p>
      <p>Disgust made him say that and now he was sorry. He scratched his chin, half a mind
         to
         let the whole mess play out, but he would never screw Cal over.</p>
      <p>“About that. Keep it mum. He’s helping a friend—no sex involved.”</p>
      <p>He leaned past Alison and scanned the kitchen. Cassie hadn’t moved. What was she doing
         here? She probably only knew two people—him and Allison.</p>
      <p>“Shite, Allie. Go offer her a drink or something, but don't mention me. She'll be
         pissed
         Caleb stood her up, and I don't want to answer questions.” Cal owed him big time.
         “Christ, I almost forgot. She doesn’t know about Caleb modeling.”</p>
      <p>Allison’s mouth dropped open. “Why not?”</p>
      <p>He shrugged. “Just go with it.”</p>
      <p>“Does she know anything about you?”</p>
      <p>“Me, no. I don’t want her to, either.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Like he suggested, Allison approached Cassie and handed her a cup. He didn’t expect
         her
         to drink it, but she did.</p>
      <p>“What are you looking at?” Alexa materialized beside him. She stared into the kitchen,
         then back at James, lips pursed.</p>
      <p>He tapped his empty cup. “Just trying to figure out what to drink.”</p>
      <p>“Isn't that Caleb's girlfriend? I'm surprised you’re not in there, hanging all over
         her.”</p>
      <p>Did he really hang all over Cassie? He got so fucked up when she was around, he had
         no
         idea if he was coming or going.</p>
      <p>“Forget it.” Alexa rolled her eyes. “You don't need a ride home, do you? Carson wants
         to
         take me out for drinks.” She held out her phone, messages open.</p>
      <p>“Don't worry about me.” Without glancing at the screen, he pulled out her keys and
         thrust them at her.</p>
      <p>She dropped the phone into her purse. “Why do I waste my time with you?”</p>
      <p>“Don’t know.” He looked away, vaguely aware of Alexa flouncing off.</p>
      <p>Cassie was no longer in the kitchen. He jerked around. Sure enough, she was on the
         dance
         floor, bumping and grinding with the other girls. At least she wasn't in the corner,
         sobbing.</p>
      <p>The song ended, and a guy, Billy Freeman, handed her another drink. Billy had been
         in
         his sophomore biology class and puked when they dissected an eyeball. Up till now,
         he
         didn’t have a problem with the guy.</p>
      <p>Cassie slammed the drink, then resumed dancing.</p>
      <p>Since he couldn’t stay where he was, James poured himself a beer and walked. He ended
         up
         in the den. Blackjack had become trendy at his school and a bunch of kids gathered
         around a circular card table. The dealer called herself Raven and was another one
         of
         Caleb’s exes.</p>
      <p>Parker Edison stood when James approached. “Here, dude.” He motioned to his chair.
         “I'm
         done.”</p>
      <p>James ignored Raven’s sigh; the seat was perfect. If he leaned to the right, he could
         keep an eye on Cassie, but it was unlikely she would notice him. He kept his hood
         up
         just in case.</p>
      <p>Six rounds later, he hadn’t won a hand and was about to give up his vigil, when the
         DJ
         played a slow song. Sure enough, Cassie’s snuggled against Billy’s chest.</p>
      <p>“James,” Raven yelled. “You’re up.”</p>
      <p>“Hit me,” he said, without checking his card. He tossed a dollar into the pot then
         leaned forward. Billy’s hands were all over Cassie’s ass.</p>
      <p>Raven dealt him the queen of hearts.</p>
      <p>“Again,” he said, eyes on Cassie. How long was this damn song?</p>
      <p>Raven snorted as she gave him a king. Groaning, James flipped his card. It was a
         jack.</p>
      <p>The long-haired guy on Raven’s right, laughed. “You asked for another card. Are you
         high?” </p>
      <p>He wasn’t high. In fact, he’d been so busy watching Cassie, he was hardly buzzed at
         all.</p>
      <p>The song ended and Cassie sprawled across a chair, drink number five, or was it six,
         in
         her hand. Billy hung over her, like a horny dog she didn’t shove away.</p>
      <p>Intent on shoving Billy for her, James slid his cards toward Raven. “I’m out.”</p>
      <p>The long-haired guy looped his arm over Raven’s shoulder. “Later, loser.”</p>
      <p>James paused. Getting into a fight on his second night of freedom would drive Caleb
         nuts, but it wasn’t Caleb’s wrath that stopped him. The chair Cassie sat on was empty.
         The need to retaliate at being insulted by some dumbass, slipped to the bottom of
         his
         priority list.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James found Allison, outside on the deck amongst a group of girls. He grabbed her
         elbow
         and pulled her away from her friends. “Have you seen Cassie?”</p>
      <p> “I thought you didn't want to see her?” Drunker than the last time they spoke, she
         waved a finger in his face.</p>
      <p>He fumbled for an excuse, not that it mattered because she kept talking. “Is it
         impossible for him to be loyal to one girl?”</p>
      <p>Alcohol had transported Allison back to ninth grade when Caleb screwed around on her,
         and he didn’t have time for it. “Just tell me if you’ve seen Cassie.”</p>
      <p>She puckered her lips. “You two think you are so entitled. You sleep with girls, then
         ditch them—and most of us don't care.”</p>
      <p>“Cassie’s out back.” A girl with a short black bob, joined them, an amethyst stone
         glimmered from her tongue as she spoke. She smiled. “I'm Emily. I sat a row over from
         you in English, last year.”</p>
      <p>“Emmy.” Allison lurched forward. She leaned on Emily for support. “Cassie is dating
         Caleb.”</p>
      <p>Caleb was fucked. Allison was bound to tell Cassie everything she knew about him,
         but it
         was not his problem.</p>
      <p>“I need to get Cassie,” he said. Surprise widened both their eyes, so he added, “and
         bring her home for Cal.”</p>
      <p>“She’s on the pier.” Emily pointed over the fence. “She claimed she needed air.”</p>
      <p>James turned toward the lake. At the base of each pier, a single lamp post lit sections
         of the beach. After that, the starlit sky bent into the black water.</p>
      <p>A shadowy figure, small in the distance, huddled at the end of the pier. Cassie could
         swim, but she drank—a lot. If she fell and hit her head, she would be a goner. Not
         wanting to fish her dead body out of the lake, he elbowed his way off the deck. He
         bolted through the yard and jumped the fence. A mound of sand against the wooden pickets
         cushioned his landing. He clamored to his feet and headed toward the water. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
