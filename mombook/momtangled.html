                     <p>James’ bicep twitched as the makeup artist rubbed another layer of concealer over
                        the letter’s FTW scrolled across his left forearm. She worked downward, toward his
                        wrist where his favorite tat, a depiction of Van Gogh’s skull smoking a joint, camouflaged
                        a fair amount of scar tissue.</p>            
                     
                     <p>He would never have taken this modeling gig had he known they would censor his ink,
                        and his wrist was the last place he wanted to be groped.</p>
                     
                     <p>With a slow inhale he planted his feet flat on the floor and focused on the hum of
                        the industrial fan. After seven years of therapy, he ought to be able to calm himself
                        down—without dissociating. But he couldn’t. </p>
                     
                     <p>His heart thudded and despite the circulating air, the room grew warmer by the minute.
                        He needed help. </p>
                     
                     <p>Luckily, it was close by.</p>
                     
                     <p>With a slight twist, he attempted to make urgent eye contact with his friend Caleb
                        who sat one chair over, dressed, ready for the photo shoot. </p>
                     
                     <p>But Caleb, who always had James’ back, missed the SOS.</p>
                     
                     <p>Instead, he stared down at the open pages of a discarded Cosmopolitan magazine. Weird
                        reading material, even for Caleb, but something had been off with him since school
                        let out for summer. He was too quiet, even distant, and no matter how much James tried,
                        two weeks of prying hadn’t loosened Cal’s tongue. </p>
                     
                     <p>James cleared his throat—but got nothing. His stomach tightened.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Stay still, por favor.” The woman frowned as her fingers skimmed Van Gogh. “Almost done.”</p>
                     
                     <p>A familiar shiver trickled down James’ spine. One he’d been taught to notice. A warning.
                        He needed out of the chair. Now. Before she asked what happened to his wrist—or didn’t
                        ask—and assumed the worst. </p>
                     
                     <p>Slouching forward, hand on his groin, he flashed his most persuasive smile. “Skip
                        that one…Cierra. I’ve got to piss.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She glanced at his pants but shook her head. “You’re not moving ‘til I finish your
                        arm.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Trapped.</p>
                     
                     <p>The air around him tightened. His body teetered weightless as his mind fought for
                        distance.</p>
                     
                     <p>In a last-ditch attempt at staying corporeal, he doodled large circles on the smooth
                        surface of the pop-up table. Another grounding technique, straight from his shrink.
                        </p>
                     
                     <p>The exercise helped until Cierra thumbed the patch of skin still sensitive from nerve
                        damage. Nausea rolled over him and a tiny whimper squeezed through his clamped jaw.
                        </p>
                     
                     <p>Screw grounding himself. Dr. Madison didn’t know shit. If he didn’t disconnect, he’d
                        knock Cierra on her ass. Once he spaced out, she could do what she wanted with his
                        body. </p>
                     
                     <p>He dropped his hand into his lap as a familiar haze slowly blanketed him. </p>
                     
                     <p>“James. Stay with us.” With a loud sigh, Caleb let the magazine slide from his knees.
                        He thumped over it as he rolled closer. “Stop messing with him. I heard your instructions.
                        Cover everything R rated, leave the rest.”  </p>
                     
                     <p>The tightness in James’ chest receded. Help at last. </p>
                     
                     <p>“What does Nár laga Dia do lámh, mean?” Cierra’s Spanish tongue slaughtered the Irish verse wound around a Celtic cross.
                        </p>
                     
                     <p>“Leave it.” Caleb’s voice was flat. </p>
                     
                     <p>“May God not weaken your hand,” James answered, the conversation a means to keep him
                        in his body, on planet earth. </p>
                     
                     <p>Where—according to everyone—he needed to be. </p>
                     
                     <p>Cierra selected a foundation brush from a clear plastic bag. “All these tattoos must
                        limit your work opportunities.” </p>
                     
                     <p>“Bloody hell, Cal.” James closed his eyes as the brush assaulted his skin but was
                        no longer on high alert. He’d passed that torch to Cal. “I’ll never be gainfully employed.
                        Whatever will I do?” </p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb chuckled. </p>
                     
                     <p>Cierra didn’t. She tapped the serpent on the inside of his right forearm. “I do like
                        the snake, though.” </p>
                     
                     <p>Twisted into a knot and dangling a clover from its mouth, the serpent was James’ biggest
                        tattoo. It hid a long, straight scar—newer than the rest—but like most of his others
                        he was clueless how he got it. </p>
                     
                     <p>Not that he cared. </p>
                     
                     <p>He turned toward Cierra’s voice. “All the girls like my snake, CiCi.” He waited for
                        Cal’s rebuke, reining him in, telling him he’d gone too far, but got nothing. </p>
                     
                     <p>“Keep your eyes and mouth closed, chaval.” Cierra shielded his nose and blasted his arm with setting spray. </p>
                     
                     <p>He knocked her hand away. “I’m eighteen. Legal. In case you were… curious.” He wasn’t
                        eighteen yet, but she didn't know that. </p>
                     
                     <p>“All done.” Her voice came from his right. “They are still setting up in the next
                        room. Put a shirt on and wait until they send for you.” </p>
                     
                     <p>James kept his eyes closed but smiled. He’d managed his stress without dissociating.
                        Sure, he had some help, but only a wee bit. Now that it was over, he felt certain
                        he could have handled it on his own. </p>
                     
                     <p>He sucked in a breath and exhaled, rolling the remaining tension from his shoulders.
                        “What do you think, Callie? You’re staring holes through me. Do I look as preppy as
                        you?” </p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb’s seat squeaked. “How would you know what I’m looking at? Your eyes are shut.”
                        </p>
                     
                     <p>James opened his eyes. Sure enough, Cierra cleaned supplies at the adjacent table,
                        and as he guessed, Caleb stared at him from his chair, his happy pink shirt and white
                        cummerbund at odds with the tightness in his jaw. </p>
                     
                     <p>“How would you know my eyes were shut if you weren’t looking?” It was unarguable logic
                        and he waited for a smart-ass reply, but Caleb only scratched the back of his neck
                        and turned toward the long wall of windows. They were high enough up to see Lake Michigan,
                        sandwiched between Chicago’s metal skyline. Scenic, sure, but it didn’t warrant more
                        than a two-second glance. </p>
                     
                     <p>James unstuck himself from the sweaty confines of the chair’s black vinyl and scooped
                        up the Cosmo magazine. Are you an enabler? the cover enquired. He dropped it on Cierra’s
                        table then strolled across the wood floor, toward a metal rack containing the required
                        outfits. The first shirt tagged for him, Fitzpatrick, was black with silver pinstripes.
                        He slipped it on, leaving it unbuttoned. </p>
                     
                     <p>“Keep the sleeves loose for now.” Cierra’s gaze lingered on his Irish Republican Army
                        tattoo, half-visible above the low waistband of his trousers. Her complexion darkened.
                        “So, how long have you two been a couple?” </p>
                     
                     <p>“I like women.” James sat down. “Older ones.” He pushed his hips forward, letting
                        the flat front pants illustrate his package. </p>
                     
                     <p>“We’re brothers,” Caleb offered, still facing the windows.</p>
                     
                     <p>They weren’t brothers and looked nothing alike. But James smiled at the term of endearment
                        Cal picked up from the years they lived together, courtesy of the Department of Children
                        and Family Services. </p>
                     
                     <p>“Twins,” James added, “identical.” He searched Cierra’s face for a reaction. </p>
                     
                     <p>She dropped the bag of brushes into her tote. “I know all about you, James. Including
                        how old you are.” </p>
                     
                     <p>“Great. She’s been warned about you.” Caleb faced him. “I’m surprised you haven’t
                        gotten fired yet.” </p>
                     
                     <p>James dug his smokes out of his backpack. Cierra didn’t know shit about him, and Cal,
                        who knew [i]everything[/i] about him, needed to chill. Cigarette between his lips,
                        he spun the chair on its axis. After a couple lazy rotations, he stopped and leveled
                        his gaze at Cierra. </p>
                     
                     <p>“So what do you think? Me and you…” </p>
                     
                     <p>Cierra lowered her bright pink tote to the floor and extended the handle. “Aren’t
                        you dating Alexa Petrov?” </p>
                     
                     <p>“Dún do bheal.” Caleb pointed at James; his brows pulled into a stern blond line. “He’s kidding.
                        Tell her you’re not serious—and not breaking the agency no dating rules.” </p>
                     
                     <p>James chuckled. Cal telling him to shut his mouth in Irish sounded as funny as Cierra’s
                        use of the word dating, but he said what Caleb wanted. He always did. </p>
                     
                     <p>“Si. Mamar gallo. Of course, I’m not.” </p>
                     
                     <p>“Is there anyone at the agency you haven’t slept with?” Caleb asked as soon as Cierra
                        shut the door, “or in the city limits?” </p>
                     
                     <p>James shrugged. “I haven’t poked the blonde ride that moved next door.” He meant it
                        as a joke. He caught Caleb spying on her as she unloaded boxes and hadn’t let him
                        forget it. </p>
                     
                     <p>“She’s not a ride,” Caleb said with more conviction than a girl they hardly knew deserved.
                        “She’s from Kansas, and I’ve been meaning to tell you, I want to get to know her;
                        do the girlfriend thing this summer, with a regular girl. One not in the scene. Also…
                        I prefer she didn’t know about this.” He motioned to the lighted vanity and rack of
                        clothes in the otherwise barren loft. His gaze rested on James. “Any of this. When
                        girls find out about modeling, they treat you different. You’re in the same boat.
                        Think about it.” </p>
                     
                     <p>The sporadic jobs they went on hardly made them models, but James shook his head.
                        Thinking was pointless and introspection was something he got plenty of during therapy.</p>
                     
                     <p>He picked his cigarettes off the table and exchanged the smoke for a blunt. One quick
                        hit was all he wanted. “You don’t think this girl will check you out? I guarantee
                        she’s already scoped out your Instagram.” </p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb eyed the blunt but let it slide. “I edited my bio and removed any incriminating
                        pictures. Besides, she lived in the country. How much can she know about fashion?”
                        </p>
                     
                     <p>“You just called her daft cause she’s not from the city. Fine way to start a relationship.” Not that he cared
                        how Cal maintained his girls, as long as they stayed out of the way. </p>
                     
                     <p>He licked the length of the blunt, the weight in his stomach lighter. If Cal’s issue
                        was getting to know some random girl before screwing her, he’d wasted two weeks of
                        vacation worrying for nothing. Caleb would never put a girl over him. Besides, from
                        the glimpse he got of her, half-hidden behind boxes, she wasn’t even hot. As fair
                        as Caleb, she resembled one of his many cousins, not a dating prospect. </p>
                     
                     <p>He shifted the blunt to the corner of his mouth. “When do I get to meet the girl that
                        has you wanting to hide who you are—before you learn who she is?” </p>
                     
                     <p>“You’re on a need-to-know basis,” Caleb said, “you have a big mouth. You’d spoil it
                        for me.” </p>
                     
                     <p>“I might.” James lit the blunt and inhaled deep. Smoke filled his lungs and would
                        work its magic on his head. He offered up a hit. </p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb waved him off. “I’ll introduce you when she wants me so bad, she won’t know
                        who she is.” </p>
                     
                     <p>“You mean when she wants you so bad, there’s no way she’d want me.” </p>
                     
                     <p>“Whatever.” Caleb frowned. “So, we’re good? You understand, right? I want some alone
                        time with this girl. At the very least, a few solid weeks to focus on her. Besides,
                        Dr. Madison said you need practice dealing with stuff, solo. Think you can survive
                        summer without me keeping you alive?” </p>
                     
                     <p>James took another hit then licked his finger and extinguished the heater. In a couple
                        days the girl would be forgotten, and he would have his friend back. When it came
                        to Caleb, solo was not a word their shared vocabulary.  </p>
                     
                     <p>He smiled wide, all teeth. “Not a problem. I don’t need you.</p>

                     <p>Cassie lifted the heavy drapery from the corner of her second-floor bedroom window.
                        Her new neighbor Caleb swam every morning, and his backstroke was the best reason
                        to wake up—ever.</p>
                     
                     <p>Her father was right. A change of scenery might be good for her.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb disappeared behind the tall, wooden fence, concealing half the pool. He emerged
                        a few seconds later, mid butterfly stroke. His arms sliced the water; powerful movements
                        that showed off great form. He had to be on the swim team. The sport she excelled
                        in before she dropped out of senior year—and out of existence.</p>
                     
                     <p>Three weeks in her new home and so far, the only friend she made was Allison, a girl
                        she met in summer school. Not the successful starting over her father wished for.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb seems nice, her dad said, the third time Caleb stopped by to invite her to swim.
                        Not all boys are like Paul.</p>
                     
                     <p>Then her dad’s new job started, and he left on a long-haul flight. The opportunity
                        to fly an Airbus A380 was the official reason her father moved his family from Kansas—not
                        just to get her out of the school district. Her mom, a flight attendant, would leave
                        tomorrow.</p>
                     
                     <p>Her mom’s absence was never a bad thing, but it did mean she would be abandoned in
                        the huge, old house—and being alone for days was well, lonely.</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie let the curtain fall into place. So far, her journal entries read, Unpacking
                        sucks… My new neighbor is cute… Yeap, summer school… and… Help. I need a life. Outside
                        of the skinny dipper she witnessed yesterday,a wild blur of dark hair and tattooed
                        skin that left her breathless, her journal contained boring entries to reflect her
                        empty world.</p>
                     
                     <p>She couldn’t tell if Caleb was trustworthy, but according to Instagram, he was a party
                        boy with a huge following.</p>
                     
                     <p>A perfect contact for meeting people before school started.</p>
                     
                     <p>Her dad didn’t know the whole story—what happened with Paul was her fault and she
                        deserved the fallout—but he did have something right. She needed to move past it,
                        meet new people and get a life.</p>
                     
                     <p>She didn’t need her dad, his voice hushed, talking to her as if she were an injured
                        animal. And she definitely didn’t need her mother. She needed a boyfriend, one she
                        wanted to have sex with. One who lived close by, available if she needed him.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb would be perfect.</p>
                     
                     <p>A small cardboard box labeled Swim sat on the corner of her desk; the only box she
                        hadn’t unpacked. She dumped its contents. Last summer’s pink bikini lay on top of
                        her ragged collection of Blue Valley High’s black and gold swimsuits. She tossed the
                        team suits into the garbage. Goodbye, Blue Valley. Goodbye, Kansas. Goodbye, Paul.</p>
                     
                     <p>Hello new existence.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>To avoid her mother, Cassie descended the narrow, back stairway to the kitchen, then
                        slipped into the backyard. She followed the fence until it ended, then padded across
                        the strip of grass to Caleb’s garage. Their wooden gate banged shut behind her; loud
                        enough to inform Caleb and half the neighborhood, of her arrival.</p>
                     
                     <p>The tight stone pathway, squeezed in between the fence and garage, ended into interlocking
                        pavers ten-odd feet from the pool. There was no sign of Caleb, but the water’s cool
                        blue ripples lured her forward.</p>
                     
                     <p>She maneuvered around a swing, between cushy lounge chairs and past potted ferns.
                        The view from her window didn’t do his landscape justice. Across the narrow yard,
                        sweet-scented, purple flowers hung from a vined pergola. Four colored Adirondack chairs
                        surrounded a small firepit. and the tiny, yellow guest house visible from her window,
                        looked cozy from the ground.</p>
                     
                     <p>She reached the deep end of the pool, toes on the curved rim, and bent to test the
                        water. Caleb broke through the surface at her feet.</p>
                     
                     <p>Gasping, she jumped back.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Holy fuck!” Caleb’s eyes were wide. “You scared the shit out of me. What are you
                        doing here?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“You said I should come swim… anytime… remember?” He sounded annoyed. Not at all like
                        the friendly guy who invited her over.</p>
                     
                     <p>Brows furrowed, he glanced toward the yellow house, then sunk under the water. When
                        he emerged, he smiled. “Sorry. I had a late night and a rough morning. Can we start
                        over?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Sure.” Her bikini strap slid off her shoulder as she lowered herself onto the pavers,
                        but Caleb’s attention was once again on the tiny house. Goosebumps pricked her arms
                        at the memory of yesterday’s streaker. She eyed the lavender door. “Are we alone?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb pulled himself out to sit beside her, his red spandex suit a second skin. “My
                        friend likes to sleep in our pool house, but if we weren’t alone, we’d have company
                        by now.” He flicked water at her. “I’m glad you came over. I thought I’d offended
                        you somehow.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I couldn’t resist the pool this morning.” What else could she say? It would help
                        if he stopped staring at her. “Does everyone around here work at Midway?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“My dad’s a pilot.” Caleb reclined, legs in the pool, elbows on the pavers. “But my
                        family is involved with The University of Chicago. My mom quit teaching when…when
                        I was ten.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He motioned to the top section of a brick house peeking over the tall pickets of the
                        fence. “My friend Ron lives over there. Both his parents are lawyers. He's kind of
                        an ass-hat, but he's here a lot.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I saw him yesterday,” she admitted, “skinny dipping.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb lurched upright; full attention on her. “I wouldn’t let his bare ass near my
                        pool, especially if I was in it.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I was in my bedroom and I…” She should have kept her mouth shut.</p>
                     
                     <p>He turned toward her house. “And your bedroom is?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Over there.” She offered a weak gesture to the gabled, double set of windows she
                        knew to be hers. “Second floor, far end. I can only see half your yard…not that I’m
                        creeping.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wow,” he said after a few seconds. “We must have given old Mrs. Watkins quite a show
                        when she lived in your house.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie grinned. If old Mrs. Watkins got yesterday’s view, she would have had a heart
                        attack. “If that wasn’t Ron, who was it?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“That would be James.” Creases appeared in Caleb’s forehead. “He used to live here.
                        You'll meet him too. Eventually.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“It doesn’t sound like you like him much.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb slid into the water and kicked off the side, seamlessly perfecting a dead man’s
                        float. His hair, a blond halo, shimmered in the ripples. After a few seconds, he got
                        his footing, sending droplets of water through the air.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I love the dude like a brother, but he has issues. I'm coming to get you.” He dove
                        under, his body a shadow heading toward her. She yanked her feet out just as he reached
                        them.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You told me you could swim,” he said when he popped up. He grinned. “You're not afraid
                        of me, are you?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She was. Residual fear leftover from Paul, but she would never admit it and planned
                        to get over it. She stepped out of her shorts and headed past the low dive, to the
                        high springboard.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Most private pools don’t have boards this high,” she said from the top.</p>
                     
                     <p>“My parents splurged. They insist if I practice enough, I will get a scholarship.
                        But truthfully, I prefer swimming over diving.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She stopped mid-board. Diving in a bikini could be risky. Did she want to end up bottomless
                        in his pool? She wanted to flirt, not look desperate.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You look pretty hot up there.” He waited alongside the edge. “Show me what you got.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She counted three steps, bounced once, and did a one and a half, forward flip, slicing
                        the surface. Her execution wasn’t perfect, but good enough. She rose in the shallow
                        end to applause.</p>
                     
                     <p>“The country girl has skills.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She could kill her mother for informing everybody they were from Kansas. “How come
                        everyone in the city thinks you're a loser if you come from a small town?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I don't think you're a loser.” Caleb disappeared under the water and closed the distance
                        between them. He surfaced inches away. “In fact, I think my summer just got a lot
                        more interesting.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Because of me?” She could play this game.</p>
                     
                     <p>Droplets of water clumped his dark lashes and accented sky-blue eyes. Not a blemish
                        or freckle marred his face. She was in over her head and half expected him to say
                        just kidding.</p>
                     
                     <p>He tilted his head. “Do you have a boyfriend missing you like crazy back home?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I didn’t date much.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“How come?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Both my parents fly all the time. They stuck me with a nanny until my sixteenth birthday.
                        I’ve never had a boyfriend that…” She bit her bottom lip. Information about Paul needed
                        to stay buried. “What about you?”</p>
                     
                     <p>He climbed the steps and headed toward the pool house. “What do you want to know?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Hmm. Let me think.” She followed but stopped short when they reached the entrance.
                        Last time she was alone with a guy, she ended up in the hospital.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb waited in the open doorway. “I’m not an axe murderer. Leave the door open if
                        you want.”</p>
                     
                     <p>With a deep breath, she crossed the threshold—and shut the door. Playing it safe ruined
                        her life in Kansas. That wouldn’t happen again.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>“Make yourself at home.” Caleb paused in front of a wide archway, housing a tiny kitchenette.
                        “I need a quick shower, or my hair will turn green.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Unable to sit in her wet swimsuit, she hovered by the door. The backside of a large
                        TV blocked her view. After a minute, she inched around it.</p>
                     
                     <p>Mismatched chairs flanked an overstuffed sofa and surrounded a wooden coffee table,
                        making the area cramped or cozy, depending on the company. The only other door, directly
                        across from the bathroom, was partly open, a bedpost visible. Against the back wall,
                        a collection of musical instruments surrounded an upright piano. She stepped closer
                        to investigate. The bathroom door opened.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb cleared his throat. He’d changed into board shorts and held two yellow towels.
                        He handed her one then plunked onto the sofa. “Come up with any questions?”</p>
                     
                     <p>After wrapping the towel around her hips, she sat on a chair. “Do you have a girlfriend
                        who might be unhappy with me being here?” That would put a hitch in her plans.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I’m offended.” He laid his hand across his heart. “I wouldn't have invited you over
                        if I did.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“But you’re cute. You must have girls all over you.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Cute.” A rosy hue climbed his neck. “Like a puppy?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Is there something wrong with that word?”</p>
                     
                     <p>He pulled one side of his mouth into a crooked smile. “I’m red, aren’t I? My friend
                        would love to witness this.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“The ass-hat or the streaker?”</p>
                     
                     <p>His smile faded. “The streaker. Hey, I'm getting hungry. Why don't you go home and
                        change? Let me take you out for lunch.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Sure,” she said. This was easier than she thought. For the first time in a year,
                        she relaxed.</p>

                     <p>The wooden screen door banged shut behind James as he entered Caleb’s kitchen. Wincing,
                        he covered his ears. Last night had been a blast, at least what he could remember
                        of it, but this morning was brutal.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb’s mom leaned against the counter as she rifled through a stack of index cards.
                        She looked up, leaving him no choice but to stumble to the center island under her
                        scrutiny. He rested his forehead on the cool marble and waited.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You look terrible,” she said, as her slippers appeared in his line of vision.</p>
                     
                     <p>He lifted his head.</p>
                     
                     <p>Before he could protest, she pressed her cool hand against his forehead. “You don’t
                        feel hot.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He feigned a cough, hoping to appear sick, but being dishonest to Elizabeth sucked.
                        Not having to lie to her was one of the reasons he moved into his own apartment.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Did Cal look sick this morning?” He lost track of Caleb sometime after midnight,
                        but he couldn’t look much better. “Maybe we have the same thing.”</p>
                     
                     <p>The creases in her forehead deepened the same way Cal’s did when something upset him.
                        “I worry about you, James.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Grateful as he was to Caleb’s mom for filling in where his own mother failed, he couldn’t
                        do emotion with her. It seemed like a breach of loyalty, somehow. He focused on the
                        fridge, but she stepped in front of him. A tactical move, that according to Dr. Madison,
                        would force him to see her. Today it worked and he met her eyes.</p>
                     
                     <p>She rested her hand on his arm. “Stay healthy, please?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Not stiffening required energy, he didn’t have. He hated hurting her, but his shoulders
                        tensed.</p>
                     
                     <p>She retreated to the counter. “You just missed Cal.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Missed him? Where did he go?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Out with our new neighbor, Cassie. Lunch, I believe.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Lunch? He took her on a date? In the daytime?” That seemed serious—and out of character.
                        For the first time Caleb’s words about wanting a girlfriend, pulled some weight.</p>
                     
                     <p>James yanked his phone from his back pocket. There were no messages from Caleb, asking
                        if he got home safe. None.</p>
                     
                     <p>He scrolled to Caleb’s name. Enough shite, he typed, I want to meet up with you and
                        Cassie.</p>
                     
                     <p>Screw his agreement to stay away.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Is something wrong?” Elizabeth asked from the end of the counter.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Cal left without checking on me.” Shit. Saying what he felt broke his standard practice.
                        Especially when what he felt sounded pathetic. His brain must still be soaked in alcohol.</p>
                     
                     <p>A sad smile flickered across Elizabeth’s lips. “I'm sure he didn't forget about you.”
                        She pushed a cup of coffee toward him. “I like Cassie. She seems more grounded than
                        the girls you meet through modeling.”</p>
                     
                     <p>It was the standard lecture, and she’d given it multiple times, ever since they gave
                        up high school girls. He sipped his coffee. At least she lost the poor baby expression.</p>
                     
                     <p>She set a small container of cream on the counter. “Sitting here in dirty pants and
                        a wrinkly T-shirt, it’s hard to imagine you're the same person in those photos. Some
                        of it reminds me of porn.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Porn. The word sounded extra dirty coming out of her mouth; and was off the table
                        for morning conversation. Coffee splashed over the rim as he plunked his cup down.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Mom. Le do thoil.” The equivalent of, Mom, please.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You know I didn’t learn Irish like your brother did.” She poured a small amount of
                        cream into her cup. “Why don't you go upstairs and take a hot bath? Go lay down in
                        the guest room and...”</p>
                     
                     <p>The guest room had been his bedroom, but he never lasted an entire night in it. He
                        ended up in Caleb’s room so often, Caleb’s father put a mattress on the floor. Cal
                        never seem to mind the intrusion. They would spend hours talking, half English, half
                        Irish, all nonsense. Not being alone at night was what he missed most when he moved.</p>
                     
                     <p>The muscles in his stomach clenched. There had been plenty of times he wished Cal
                        would lighten up and get off his tail, but now that he had, the abandonment stung.</p>
                     
                     <p>Elizabeth stared at him from across the block. Had she said something else? Not cool.
                        She was the last person he wanted to zone out in front of.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Jacuzzi… James... You need more sleep.” She retrieved his anti-anxiety meds from
                        the cupboard above the sink and shook one into her palm. She gave him an encouraging
                        smile. “Just take it and go clean up.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Unlike his real mother, Caleb’s mom proved trustworthy. He swallowed the pill with
                        the rest of his coffee then reached for an apple from the fruit bowl. “Wake me up
                        by noon, please.” He took a bite. “I have this casting thing. To walk in fall fashion
                        week,”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Today?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Yeah.” He stopped chewing. “What?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Elizabeth shook her head. “I realize the state views you as an adult, but if I had
                        any say in it, I would insist you call in sick. This is exactly why I disagreed with
                        your emancipation. Seventeen is too young to be on your own. You look terrible.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Don’t worry.” He tried not to smile. “It's not my face they're interested in.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Elizabeth’s mouth dropped open.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I’m teasing,” he said. “Shit, Cal would kill me if I did that.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Not that it mattered. After sending that text, Caleb would kill him, anyway.</p>

                     <p>Caleb curled around Cassie on the pool house sofa; his chin nuzzled against the top
                        of her head. The shopping trip went off without a hitch. They ate supper out, then
                        settled down to watch TV Land’s Fantasy Island marathon. It may not have been exciting,
                        but with short notice, it was the best he could do. Besides, Cassie had never seen
                        the show, or any of the retro series he loved.</p>
                     
                     <p>The shrill ring from the cordless phone on the end table jarred Caleb from his TV
                        coma. He stretched to answer it, expecting his mother who used the landline like an
                        intercom.</p>
                     
                     <p>James’ number lit the screen instead.</p>
                     
                     <p>He scrambled over Cassie. Since he didn’t want his first words to be, “Where the hell
                        are you?” he took a relaxing breath. “What’s up?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Is this Cal?” The voice on the other end was unsure, and female.</p>
                     
                     <p>Not used to strangers calling him Cal, or girls on the other end of James’ line, he
                        paused.</p>
                     
                     <p>“James told me to call you if needed,” the girl said, “but your other number went
                        right to voicemail.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Damn. To appease Cassie, he hadn’t touched his phone all evening. He glanced at her,
                        still absorbed in Fantasy Island, unaware the quiet evening just blew up.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Who are you?” he asked, stepping away from the sofa.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I'm his sitter.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Sitter?” Caleb wet his lips. “Where’s James? Why didn’t he call me himself?”</p>
                     
                     <p>The girl huffed, “Never mind. You're freaking. I’ll take care of it myself.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“No... I'm not freaking out.” He tightened his grip on the slick plastic receiver.
                        “I'm trying to figure out what's going on.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Who is that?” Cassie mouthed.</p>
                     
                     <p>He motioned to give him a moment, then cranked the volume on the TV. He stalked into
                        the kitchen. “Is James okay?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I think so.” The girl sounded unsure. “He's breathing, but he hit his head. I’d let
                        him lie there, but my boyfriend called. He’s on his way home and James has to be gone.”</p>
                     
                     <p>It wasn’t a good visual. He wanted to reach through the phone and shake her. “Where
                        are you?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“5950 South Wells. It's in Fuller Park. The quickest way is to drop down to 47th.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb yanked his cell from his pocket. “Typing the address in now.” The map showed
                        him the same way. “You know where I live?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Just hurry up.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I will.” He headed to the sofa. “Give me ten minutes.”</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>“I have to go,” he said as he slipped into his shoes. Cassie gaped at him, but he
                        had no intention of offering an explanation. He circled the room. “Where are my damn
                        keys?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Calm down.” She located the keys from beside the TV then pressed them into his palm.
                        “Is everything okay?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Nothing was okay. He should never have brushed James off. His mother would kill him
                        if something bad happened—and he would never forgive himself.</p>
                     
                     <p>He headed for the door. “I need to go help a friend.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I got that. Can I come?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Nope.” Images of getting shot at by some gang banger floated through his head. It
                        would be impossible to watch out for her and James at the same time. “It might get
                        dicey. You should go home.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Sounds intriguing.” She snatched her purse and followed him across the grass, to
                        the garage. “You might need me. I'll be good.” She crossed her fingers over her heart.</p>
                     
                     <p>Dragging her into a James situation would irrevocably change the solitude he’d been
                        enjoying. But her eyes were bright. She seemed excited by the possibility of danger.
                        Their earlier conversation floated back to him. She craved excitement while he wanted
                        peace. It was like they were on two different tracks heading in opposite directions.</p>
                     
                     <p>She opened the passenger door and smiled over the car. “Come on, Caleb. Let me help
                        you.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Get in,” he said. There was no time to waste.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>img???</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>“Is it possible to get anywhere in Chicago in ten minutes?” Cassie asked over the
                        bass line pounding from his car speakers. She clung to the door as they squealed around
                        the first corner, but he had no intention of slowing down. “Whose car is this? It
                        looks like the one on Dukes of Hazzard.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I'm impressed.” He flashed her a wide smile, happy for the distraction. “It’s mine.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“You own a car? Why do we walk so much?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Walking's the best way to learn a city.” He turned the radio down. “I might need
                        you to drive James’ car home. It’s a stick.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I can drive a stick,” she said, proudly, “I’ve driven the tractor on my grandpa’s
                        farm. Told you I’d be helpful.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Look, Cassie.” What did he want to convey? “You seem excited by all this and James
                        is my best friend—but he's messed up.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Messed up how?”</p>
                     
                     <p>No longer able to avoid the topic, he sighed. “Without getting into it, his parents
                        were wackjobs. He got a ton of cash from them, along with a scrambled head. He lived
                        with us because the state placed him there.”</p>
                     
                     <p>"That’s how you met?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“We met at the University of Chicago. We were part of this long-term study my mom
                        helped run.” He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. “We learned musical selections
                        followed by several types of math tests. I’ve known James since I was six. Take it
                        from me, he’s all over the place—and can find trouble.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wow.” Cassie stared at him.</p>
                     
                     <p>It was an impressed sounding wow, the opposite of what he wanted.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wow, what?” He clicked the radio off and waited.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You guys must be smart—and James sounds intriguing.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Intriguing? He gave her a sideways look, trying to get a handle on her expression.
                        “There is nothing Intriguing or even interesting about him. Keep your distance, okay?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Okay.” She chuckled.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Seriously.” Caleb poked her shoulder. “He's unpredictable—and charming. It's a deadly
                        combination.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She poked him back. “It sounds like you're scared I'll run away with him. Did he steal
                        one of your many girlfriends?”</p>
                     
                     <p>That was the funniest thing she’d said. “Believe me, he doesn’t need my girls.”</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>break-img???-break</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Cassie released a relieved sigh when they rounded the corner onto Wells. They made
                        it in under fifteen minutes.</p>
                     
                     <p>“What was the address?” she asked, not that it mattered. Not all the buildings had
                        numbers—or windows. They passed one without a front door.</p>
                     
                     <p>“5950.” Caleb slowed the Charger. “There it is.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He parked in front of a vintage, black Mustang that blended into the night. If that
                        was James’ car, the ride back would be fun.</p>
                     
                     <p>A squat, one-story brick building sat back from the curb, a blanket draped its front
                        window. This is how she imagined the South Side. This was exciting.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb banged on the metal door. She peeked over his shoulder as the door inched open.</p>
                     
                     <p>A skinny young woman appeared in the gap. She pushed stringy black bangs away from
                        her eyes and gave them a scrutinizing once over. “Are you Cal?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Caleb,” he corrected, his shoulder against the door, like he planned to barrel through
                        if needed. “Where’s James? And who are you?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“He’s still out of it.” She moved to let them pass into a messy, living room. “I told
                        you, I’m his sitter. You can call me T. That’s all you need to know.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I don't get it,” Cassie whispered when the girl turned to secure three huge locks,
                        “who is she?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb shifted his gaze to the floor. “A sitter watches you when you get high to make
                        sure you don't hurt yourself.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“She didn't do a very good job,” Cassie said loud enough for T to hear.</p>
                     
                     <p>“He’s in the bedroom,” the girl said as she passed them. Her gaze brushed over Cassie,
                        “Something freaked him out; he jumped off the sofa and took off running. Just get
                        him and go.”</p>
                     
                     <p>The back room contained no bed—or anything that made it worthy of the title, bedroom,
                        and smelled like a bathroom. Cassie stopped in the middle of the scattered cardboard
                        boxes and discarded piles of clothes and waited for her eyes to adjust to the low
                        watt bulb dangling from the ceiling. It took a few seconds to locate James, face down
                        on the cracked linoleum.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Damn it.” Caleb rushed forward. “Is there another light in here?”</p>
                     
                     <p>T fumbled with a floor lamp and all three of its arms clicked on. She adjusted one
                        of the arms and a bright circle of light crept across the floor, illuminating the
                        situation.</p>
                     
                     <p>So, this was the mystical James. The streaker. His unbuttoned shirt fanned out on
                        either side of him, the tips of his dark hair tucked under the collar. One of the
                        sleeves was cuffed and his tattooed forearm twisted at an uncomfortable angle from
                        his body. Blood splattered the dirty white paint of the open closet door.</p>
                     
                     <p>More curious than scared, Cassie inched forward. She sidestepped a pool of liquid
                        and knelt as Caleb carefully rolled James over.</p>
                     
                     <p>James’ bangs, the ends matted, tumbled off his face. A gash across his forehead had
                        bled out and gaped open. His top lip was split and swollen. The front of his jeans,
                        soaked with urine, explained the puddle on the floor and the smell in the room.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb drew a long breath, his face white. “Jesus.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie also took a breath. James’ long lashes curled in an enviable manor, his cheek
                        bones prominent, his jaw strong. Even in his current state, James was beautiful. And
                        like a broken china doll, his ruin pulled at her heart in the same manner. It seemed
                        intrusive to witness such vulnerability in a stranger. She looked across to Caleb.
                        </p>
                     
                     <p>His eyes flicked to her, as if to catch her reaction, then he lit into T. “What the
                        fuck did he take?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Magic mint,” T said from the shadows outside the ring of light. “At least that's
                        all I know about. He was boozed up when he got here.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“He drove here? Drunk?” The muscle in Caleb’s jaw flexed.</p>
                     
                     <p>T nodded. “He brought a bag of the stuff and insisted on trying it. He asked if I
                        would watch him—and just so you know, I tried to talk him out of it.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie looked at T, the ground, the walls, and the piles of laundry. Anywhere but
                        the body between her and Caleb. Finally, her eyes rested on the interwoven symbol
                        inked on the top of James’ left hand, the words Tus Nua printed underneath. His fingers
                        were long; the nails appeared manicured. The letters, T.A.K.E were scrolled above
                        his knuckles. The gold band of an aquamarine ring obscured the top of the A</p>
                     
                     <p>Her gaze jumped to his stomach, stretched flat between his hip bones. The inked letter
                        I sat at the top of a curved design; the rest of the image remained hidden beneath
                        his pants. She tilted her head, to try to view the narrow gap between the button of
                        his jeans and his skin. The shiver that played between her shoulder blades, shot down
                        her spine.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I can't believe Salvia did this.” Caleb regained some color. He pushed up James’
                        shirtsleeve and inspected the skin. “Cassie, check his other arm.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James’ hand twitched, warm against her palm. The underside of his wrist housed a skull
                        tattoo. A cross and more foreign words covered his forearm. The ink made it difficult
                        to see actual skin, and with no experience in the body checking category, she was
                        lost. “What am I looking for?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Needle marks,” T answered.</p>
                     
                     <p>Stirring, James’ eyes flickered open, a circle of sea green ringed his dilated pupils.
                        He pulled his arm from Caleb’s grasp. “No needles, Callie.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James’ gaze caught hers and held. She inhaled so sharply Caleb jerked his head up.
                        At that moment, she didn’t care. Everything but James faded into obscurity.</p>
                     
                     <p>He blinked up at her. “Are you my angel?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She dropped his hand.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb sat back on his heels and looked toward T. “God, he's still tripping. Do you
                        have his keys?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“He didn't give them to me.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Groaning, Caleb patted James’ wet, front pockets.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Screw off.” James pushed the intrusion away.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb easily caught James’ wrist. He pinned it under his knee, then reached into the
                        left pocket. His disgusted expression relieved the tightness coiled inside her and
                        she chuckled.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb’s scowl deepened. “What are you laughing at? You’re his angel. You should do
                        this.” He pulled out a keyring and wiped them on his shorts before tossing them into
                        her lap. “You’re driving, remember. That was his Mustang I parked in front of. Help
                        me get him on his feet.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Obeying, she looped her arm around James’ middle where it rested against the warmth
                        of his lower back. An unfamiliar bubble tickled her insides.</p>
                     
                     <p>T followed them to the front door.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb held out his hand. “Where's his phone?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She retrieved an iPhone from the cluttered coffee table and dropped it into Caleb’s
                        palm.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wallet, money, anything else?” Caleb said, “if he can't find his wallet tomorrow,
                        I'm coming back.”</p>
                     
                     <p>T unlocked the door and yanked it open. “You have it all.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb carried most of James weight as he maneuvered through the doorway. “Thanks for
                        calling.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Not a problem.” T slammed the door, leaving them on the tiny cement landing.</p>
                     
                     <p>James' body tensed against Cassie’s side.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Callie?” he blurted out like a frightened child. “Ta' slaghda'norm!” The words were
                        slurred and not English.</p>
                     
                     <p>“We're almost to the car.” Caleb quickened his pace and she struggled to keep up.</p>
                     
                     <p>They made the street, but James stopped short. “I'm gonna boke.” He gagged.</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie didn’t need experience to recognize that sound. She jumped off the curb. James
                        heaved once, nothing but liquid, and Caleb shouldered him the remaining few steps
                        toward the car.</p>
                     
                     <p>“It’s okay.” He braced James’ hands against the hood. “You'll be home in a bit.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Maybe you should call an ambulance,” Cassie suggested.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb gave her an incredulous look and she kicked at the broken asphalt under her
                        sandals. “How often do you do this?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Go scumming? Me, never.” He kept his focus on James. “Usually, our nights are a bit
                        more upscale and sometimes it's me that needs to be brought home. But it's alcohol
                        I'm sick on, no drugs. Well, maybe a little weed. But nothing stronger.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“How come he didn't get you to be his sitter?” It made more sense to her.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Because he knows I would never let him do this,” he waved both arms at James, “to
                        himself. Booze is one thing but look at him.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James’ breathing regulated, but his arms vibrated. His eyes skated over her, to Caleb.
                        “How did I get here?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb’s posture tensed. “You don’t remember coming here? At all? Tell me this wasn’t
                        an episode.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Scith a ligean, Arsehole.” James’ gaze caught hers.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb glanced at her as well. “Screw off, James,” he said, “I am relaxed.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He helped James into the back seat then leaned in to click the seatbelt. After shutting
                        the door, he faced her. “Follow me. And don't worry; I plan on going slow.”</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Cassie had no problem shadowing the bright orange Charger. She parked behind them
                        on the concrete driveway. “Should I leave his car here?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb nodded. He opened the Charger’s door and adjusted the driver’s seat forward,
                        as far as it could go. James had piled up in the back. He jumped when Caleb reached
                        for him.</p>
                     
                     <p>“It’s me.” Caleb reached in again. “You’re good.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He propped James against the car where he promptly slid into a squat. A groan floated
                        up from under his hair.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Stay with him.” Caleb threw her an apologetic smile. “I’m going into the house for
                        the first aid kit. I’ll be right back.” </p>
                     
                     <p>James swiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then peered up at her through his
                        bangs. He smiled. “My angel still here.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He sounded more lucid, but she couldn’t narrow down his garbled accent other than
                        somewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
                     
                     <p>Bit by bit, he inched his way up the car then lounged against it, as if they were
                        hanging out on a normal night. It might have been more believable if his attire wasn’t
                        a complete disaster. Despite the situation, his expression remained confident.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Hi. I’m James.” He looked downward, at himself, then back to her. His smile widened.
                        “My greatest apologies for being such a mess.”</p>
                     
                     <p>A dab of blood formed on his split lip, which he licked.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb’s warning flashed through her brain. James was unpredictable and charming—a
                        hot mess. What kind of person would do this to themselves? He pushed himself off the
                        car and headed through the gate into the backyard, towards the pool house.</p>
                     
                     <p>Since she was supposed to keep an eye on him, she followed.</p>
                     
                     <p>The screen door in the main house slammed shut and Caleb came up behind them. “Whoa.
                        I told you to wait for me.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James opened the pool house door. “Is gá dom a bhaint as an seomra folctha.” He stepped into the bright room.</p>
                     
                     <p>A blast of frigid air hit Cassie as she followed.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb scooted past her. “Ta tu ro-dheanach, dude,”</p>
                     
                     <p>Unsure what to do, she lounged cross armed against the wall. “What did he say?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“That he needs to use the bathroom.” Caleb shook his head. “I told him it was too
                        late.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James glared at Caleb. “Póg mo thóin, Cal.” Jutting his chin toward her, he added,
                        “You can kiss my ass too, Luv, if you like.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Rude,” she said, but bit back a smile.</p>
                     
                     <p>James hit the light switch, leaving them in the glow of the television. He stumbled
                        across the room, toward the bedroom.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wait.” Caleb flicked the light on. “You’re not crashing. I need to check out that
                        cut and your clothes are… gross.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I planned on stripping, Mam.” James let his shirt slide off his shoulders and undid
                        his jeans.</p>
                     
                     <p>“James.” Caleb pointed to her, still by the door. “We have company.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She waved.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb pulled one of the chairs away from the tiny bistro table. “Come over here.”
                        He patted the wood. “Sit. Please.”</p>
                     
                     <p>With an unhappy grunt, James sat. His eyes found hers and stuck. If he thought she
                        would rescue him, he was mistaken.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Cassie.” Caleb opened the first aid kit and lit the flashlight on his phone. “Can
                        you please go soak a cloth in hot water?”</p>
                     
                     <p>When she headed toward the kitchen sink, he added, “in the bathroom.”</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>A neat stack of folded face cloths occupied a basket on the bathroom counter. Cassie
                        selected one and turned on the hot water. After the cloth was hot, she wrung it out
                        then shut the water off.</p>
                     
                     <p>A hushed conversation floated from the next room.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Damn it.” There was a hint of pleading in Caleb’s voice. “I know you have a death
                        wish but think about Mom. Think about me.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“You?” said James, “I haven't seen you since that Soith moved next door.” </p>
                     
                     <p>She gasped. Whatever a soith was, it didn’t sound pleasant. James hated her, and hadn’t
                        even met her yet.</p>
                     
                     <p>“That’s what this is all about?” Caleb was no longer whispering. “You’re jealous?
                        Don't you realize what it does to me to have to pick you up like that? Covered in
                        blood and piss. Fuck. Slow down. I can't keep up.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Don’t try, then.” James coughed. “Stop fussing over me. Go play with your girlfriend.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie heard enough. They quieted as she entered the room. “How’s the patient?” she
                        asked, handing over the face cloth.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Crashing.” Caleb scowled. “And in a foul mood.” He pressed the cloth against James’
                        forehead. </p>
                     
                     <p>Water trickled down James’ cheeks and he shirked away. “I want her to do it.”</p>
                     
                     <p>"Fuck off, James.” Caleb hovered the cloth over the wound. “Stay still.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James knocked Caleb’s hand away. He glowered at Cassie. “Hurry up. I already told
                        you, I need to piss, and go to bed. Preferably in that order.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Damn it.” Caleb shoved the cloth at her. “Do you mind? There’s no point arguing with
                        him. He won't remember anything in the morning.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Come on, angel.” James smirked. “I won't bite…unless you want me to.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb sighed. “Stop being such an ass. Tip your head back and shut up.”</p>
                     
                     <p>The cloth felt foreign in Cassie’s grip, the role of caretaker unfamiliar. Nobody
                        needed her. Ever. She pushed James’ hair back, then pressed the material against his
                        cut. The muscle in his jaw clenched. He placed his hand over hers.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You’re done.” Caleb removed James’ hand. “You'll have to make do with me. Your angel
                        is leaving.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James kept his gaze on her but remained cooperative as Caleb finished cleaning the
                        area, applied first aid cream, then slapped on a couple of butterfly bandages.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Do you need help to the bathroom?” Caleb asked.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Feck off, Cal.” The chair teetered, as James got to his feet. He raised an eyebrow
                        at Cassie, then staggered to the sofa where he fell face-first onto the cushions.</p>
                     
                     <p>It took Cassie a few seconds to notice Caleb held the door open.</p>
                     
                     <p>“That was awkward,” she offered as she stepped into the night. “And just so you know,
                        he forgot to pee.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb took her hand and hurried her through the gate. “He'll probably get up in a
                        few hours and break his nose on the bathroom sink. But hell, I tried.”</p>
                     
                     <p>They reached her front door. Dark windows informed her; her mother was in bed.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Thanks for being there for me tonight,” Caleb said, as she dug her key out of her
                        purse, “James is a train wreck, but I'm all he has.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“His stepdads in Statesville prison, an hour’s drive from here.” Caleb glanced down.
                        “Hopefully, his mothers in hell. She hung herself about a year and a half ago. James
                        got all her cash—and she had a lot of it.” He met her eyes. “Don't let on you know
                        any of this.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“That’s horrible.” James’ issues were more serious than she’d imagined. “If I ever
                        see him again, my lips are sealed.</p>
                     
                     <p>He kissed her forehead. “About that. I haven’t spent much time with him lately—and
                        need to keep him close. What I’m saying is, James is going to hang with us more often.”</p>
                     
                     <p>A tiny pulse of adrenaline flitted through Cassie’s body. Small enough to ignore.
                        She smiled. “I promise I won't run away with him.”</p>
                     
                     <p>It was a joke, but Caleb’s expression remained blank.</p>
                     
                     <p>She stuck the key in the lock. “I thought you didn't want me around him.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I also don't want to attend his funeral.” Caleb backed off the steps. “Sorry our
                        evening ended so crazy.”</p>
                     
                     <p>It had been crazy, but also exhilarating, and a far cry from her evenings in Kansas.
                        She would have told him it was fine, but he disappeared through the gate before she
                        could reply.</p>

                     <p>For the first time since Cassie moved in, Caleb skipped his morning workout. She pulled
                        on her robe and headed downstairs. An empty wine bottle sat on the kitchen table.
                        Two twenties stuck out from underneath, along with a folded paper.</p>
                     
                     <p>Flying standby to meet your dad. Be back in a few days. Love, Mom.</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie tossed the note into the garbage, then dialed Caleb. Her call went straight
                        to voicemail.</p>
                     
                     <p>By noon, she had called Caleb five times.</p>
                     
                     <p>For supper, she boiled Ramen noodles but couldn’t choke them down. Pacing the kitchen,
                        she tried Caleb again. This time she left a message.</p>
                     
                     <p>Call me. PLEASE. He’d get back to her now.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Laughter from the pool reached her bedroom window. Groaning, Cassie rolled over. It
                        couldn’t possibly be morning, but daylight said otherwise. At least Caleb was outside.
                        Two days minus his swim routine would feel like an alternate universe. She headed
                        to the window.</p>
                     
                     <p>James sat beside the pool eating a banana, while Caleb drifted close by on an inflatable
                        lounger. He sipped a drink—like he hadn't a care in the world.</p>
                     
                     <p>She snatched her phone from the tangled sheets and dialed his number. She couldn’t
                        hear his phone ring, but Caleb’s head jerked to the tiny poolside table. He motioned
                        to her house, bringing James’ gaze to her window.</p>
                     
                     <p>Topless, she stepped back but what the heck? He ignored her call. Screw him—and his
                        crazy friend. They could have each other.</p>
                     
                     <p>The day dragged. By evening, claps of thunder had her jumping out of her skin and
                        lightning split a rainless sky. After checking all the locks, she headed upstairs.</p>
                     
                     <p>Though she kept the curtains open, her room seemed extra dark. Last night’s dream
                        floated back. She had fallen into a pit and no matter how loud she yelled, no one
                        came. Despite the humidity, she pulled the sheet to her chin.</p>
                     
                     <p>The clock on her dresser glowed twelve-thirty; ten minutes since she last checked.
                        Every second of solitude seemed like an eternity. She got out of bed. Anything would
                        be better than lying there.</p>
                     
                     <p>Warm light shone from the pool house like a welcoming beacon. What would Caleb do
                        if she banged on his door and asked why he ignored her? Showing up in her translucent
                        cami and pajama shorts might loosen his tongue.</p>
                     
                     <p>The moonless sky made the night blacker than usual. She slipped through the gate into
                        Caleb’s backyard and skittered barefoot past the pool, the water dark and bottomless
                        in the night air. Something rustled under the wisteria vine. A wave of panic sent
                        her through the unlocked door without knocking.</p>
                     
                     <p>She stopped short. James sat, relaxed against the sofa cushions, bathed in the soft
                        light of the muted television. His eyes were closed. Naked, except for white boxer
                        briefs, his bare legs sprawled across the coffee table. A guitar rested on the cushion
                        beside him, and music emanated from the Bose speaker next to his feet.</p>
                     
                     <p>Despite her lack of attire, the air-conditioned room became hot. Fueled by the rush
                        of being where she shouldn’t, she stepped around the TV. A thick inked band circled
                        James’ left ankle. Letters twisted up his right thigh. His briefs rode low enough
                        to read the word Unity, but the picture it curved around remained hidden.</p>
                     
                     <p>“And you are?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She jerked her head up. His eyes were locked on her, one eyebrow raised. Confusion
                        flicked across his features.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb was right. James had no memory of her.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Can you speak?” Both brows were now raised, and a smile played on his lips. He made
                        no effort to cover up.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You’re not dressed,” was all she could come up with.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You’re in my bedroom.” He rested his hands on his thighs. “Good thing I didn't fall
                        asleep naked with my wank in my hand. Who did you say you were again?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Cassie. I live next door.” She pointed in the direction of her house.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Ah.” His jaw tightened; all signs of humor gone. “You must be looking for my brother.
                        Funny, he’s never mentioned you.” His gaze flicked to her chest. “But I'm sure he'll
                        be sorry he missed this.”</p>
                     
                     <p>What a liar. James may not remember the other night, but Caleb must have mentioned
                        her. He looked right at her bedroom window this morning.</p>
                     
                     <p>She crossed her arms. “Brother?” She may not know much about his and Caleb’s relationship,
                        but she knew they weren’t related.</p>
                     
                     <p>He snorted but his dismissive expression wavered. “He didn’t tell you he had a brother?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She shook her head.</p>
                     
                     <p>“It’s late.” He toward the clock. “Cal’s not here so you can go home.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Home was the last place she wanted to go, and here was the last place she should be,
                        but she couldn’t make her feet move. At least in the pool house she wasn’t alone.
                        </p>
                     
                     <p>James scratched his chin. “Why did you come here? It's the middle of the night yet
                        you show up—wearing that.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Her reasoning made more sense from her bedroom.</p>
                     
                     <p> “Hello?” He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “I’m waiting.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I had a bad dream,” she said.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Why isn’t more clothing involved if all you want is comfort?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Her cheeks heated, but it was hard to act indignant in her current attire. “Caleb
                        hasn't been answering my calls. I wanted to talk to him to see why.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“And you figure showing up here wearing skimpy pajamas will make it harder for him
                        to throw you out on your ass.”</p>
                     
                     <p>It was exactly what she figured but sounded ridiculous coming out of his mouth.</p>
                     
                     <p>James scooped his phone from the coffee table. He turned the music down and relaxed
                        against the sofa, arms behind his head. “So…Caleb hasn't talked to you for a couple
                        of days. I can't imagine why.”</p>
                     
                     <p>His smug smile said he knew why—but didn’t plan on telling. Tears filled her eyes.
                        They'd probably spent the last two days making fun of her.</p>
                     
                     <p>His smile evaporated. He ran his hand through his hair then, with a sigh, retrieved
                        a pair of jeans from the floor and stepped into them. Leaving them undone, he headed
                        to the kitchen.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I can feel your eyes drilling holes in my back,” he said, as he faced her. “You’re
                        making my head throb.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I’m giving you a headache?” He couldn’t be serious.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Do you know what the term ‘being eye-fucked’ means, and how it might apply in this
                        situation?” He motioned between them.</p>
                     
                     <p>Of course, she knew what it meant, but blinked at him, speechless.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Forget it.” He shook his head. “Can I interest you in a nice cup of tea?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“A nice cup of tea?” There was that accent again. Less evident now that he was sober,
                        but still confusing.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Holy fuck, angel. Do you parrot Cal like this?”</p>
                     
                     <p>He called her angel.</p>
                     
                     <p>James stepped backwards. “Why in the name of our Lord do you keep staring at me? I’m
                        a fecking boy. Have you not noticed us before? We make up half the planet.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I'm sorry.” She snapped out of her daze. “I'm admiring your tattoos.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Don’t they have ink in Kansas?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Ha. He knew where she was from, concrete proof he heard about her. She smiled. “You
                        seem to know more about me than I know about you.”Ha. He knew where she was from,
                        concrete proof he heard about her. She smiled. “You seem to know more about me than
                        I know about you.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wow. It’s capable of conversation.” He rounded the arch into the kitchen.</p>
                     
                     <p>She followed, but lingered in the entrance.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Okay. You caught me.” He waved a box of tea bags at her. “I know a little bit about
                        you. My brother likes to talk about his slappers.”</p>
                     
                     <p>From the disgusted twist of his mouth, slapper wasn’t complimentary. He sat the box
                        on the counter. A tiny leprechaun danced across the front, leaving a trail of clovers.
                        Clovers. James was Irish.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Your accent…” she trailed off, unsure of a nasty comeback.</p>
                     
                     <p>James finished filling a kettle. “Can it finish a sentence?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Are you English?” Not much of an insult, but from his sneer, she hit a nerve.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wrong. Irish.” He slammed a mug on the counter. “I hate being mistaken for English.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I hate being mistaken for a…slapper.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He studied her a second. “Touché.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I thought all Irishmen had red hair,” she teased, “are you sure you’re Irish?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Allow me to broaden your knowledge. All Irishmen aren’t redsers. But it’s moot in
                        my case because my real father was from the Ukraine. And, to answer your second, brilliant
                        question, since I grew up in Belfast and my last name is Fitzpatrick, I'm pretty sure
                        I'm Irish.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“You and Caleb aren’t real brothers then,” she pointed out, curious how he would answer.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Not by blood.” He turned his back to her. A second later, he handed her a sunny yellow
                        cup with a string hanging over the side. “Honey?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“What?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“For your tea.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He sat on the sofa and blew into his cup. “It's good. Full of antioxidants."</p>
                     
                     <p>“No thanks.” She sat opposite the sofa and sipped her beverage. “Do you speak Gaelic?
                        Or Ukrainian?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“It's called Irish. Apparently, I think I am fluent when I’ve been drinking. Why do
                        you ask?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Sometimes you sound like you have an accent, like when you say fuck as feck. Other
                        times, you sound normal.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Feck is the politer version. It’s not an accent.” He balanced his mug on his leg.
                        “But otherwise, I’ve been here for a while. I've assimilated. Thanks for your educated
                        thoughts on what’s normal though.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Crap, she offended him without trying to. “I like the way you talk. Say something
                        in Irish.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Tá tú álainn.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She blinked, surprised he went along with her request. “What does that mean?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“It means, you should go home.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She wasn’t sure if he was kidding and didn’t want to leave. When he dropped the sarcasm,
                        his banter became fun. “Say purple?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Corcra.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Say dog.”</p>
                     
                     <p></p>
                     
                     <p>He sighed. “Madra.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“How do you say, I peed my pants?” How could he not remember an entire night? She
                        tried not to smile.</p>
                     
                     <p>He kept his gaze on hers. “You look dry from here.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She blew into her cup.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Pissed me' mo trousers. At least that’s how I'd say it. But I advise against doing
                        it. You’re sitting in Cal's favorite chair.” He set his mug on the table. “So, you
                        want to know why Cal’s ignoring you?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She nodded, mid-sip, eager to find out what she did wrong.</p>
                     
                     <p>“He’s just busy.” He narrowed his eyes. “You can drop that puppy dog, ‘I’m so hurt
                        my boyfriend is ignoring me,’ act. Cal may be gullible, but I recognize a Siren when
                        I see one.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“You think I’m a Siren?” Who even used that word?</p>
                     
                     <p>James’ gaze drifted south, to her legs. When he looked up, his eyes were dark. “All
                        I’m saying is I think you have other motives.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I was too upset to sleep. You still think I’m a man-eater?”</p>
                     
                     <p>His expression blanked. “I told you what I thought of you earlier, in Irish.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“You wanted me to go home?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I said, I think you are rather beautiful.”</p>
                     
                     <p>The word beautiful, sounded exotic coming off his tongue. Damn. Charming. Don’t let
                        him charm you.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Cover yourself.” He placed a cushion in his lap, then tossed her the fuzzy yellow
                        blanket from the back of the sofa. “I've got the air cranked.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She draped it around her shoulders. “What are we listening to?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Thrash metal. What do you listen to?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Whatever’s on WKSC. You know, Kiss FM.” She named off some hot female singers, thinking
                        he would appreciate their sex appeal, but he grimaced.</p>
                     
                     <p>“I like Adele, too.” Adele was her favorite vocalist. She waited for his reaction.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Those feckin’ Brits can sing.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He clicked the music off and reached for the guitar. “You like Zeppelin?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Sure,” she agreed, though not one Zeppelin song came to mind.</p>
                     
                     <p>Eyes closed; he played a melancholy tune. After a minute, he stopped and peered at
                        her. “Do you like it?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She nodded. “The music’s sad.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“It’s about a woman’s journey for meaning in a world of ambiguity. I can play the
                        flute parts, too.” He jutted his chin toward the instruments. “The million-dollar
                        question is, can you name that song?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She had no idea what the song was, and after that deep and insightful speech, she
                        didn’t know who James was, either. Shrugging, she set her empty cup down. “I don’t
                        know the title, but you sounded good.”</p>
                     
                     <p>He nodded like he heard that a lot. “So, angel, fess up.” After adjusting the music
                        to a comfortable volume, he reclined, fingers a pyramid in front of his chest. “I’ll
                        be your therapist. Tell me what you dreamt about."</p>
                     
                     <p>Telling him she had been forgotten in a hole sounded dumb. “I don’t remember,” she
                        said.</p>
                     
                     <p>He grinned like he could read her mind. “Dreams are just dreams; life, now that’s
                        scary.”</p>
                     
                     <p>She may be lonely, but outside of Paul, she had never been scared. James turned the
                        TV off and lit a cigarette. Its burning heater possessed hypnotic qualities in the
                        dark room.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Does Caleb smoke?” Sometimes he smelled like smoke, but she never saw him with a
                        cigarette.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Ask him.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Her eyes fought to close. “Wow. That tea really works. This is the most relaxed I've
                        been all year.” Relaxed was an understatement. She struggled to get the words out.</p>
                     
                     <p>Her head bobbed. She jerked upright but couldn't escape the sensation of falling off
                        the chair. Strong arms encircled her. Lifted her. Pulled her from the pit. She floated
                        through space until firmness welcomed her.</p>
                     
                     <p>“No bad dreams tonight. I promise,” James’ voice said. She held the hand that belonged
                        to the voice and didn't want to let go.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Don't leave me,” she imagined saying, squeezing tighter, “keep me safe.”</p>
                     
                     <p>The firmness under her shifted, and something warm sided against her. Her fogged brain
                        called it a leg. She snuggled against it, enjoying the slight pressure of fingers
                        in her hair.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Talk to me.” she got out, not scared, just relaxed.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Shh,” he said. His chest rose and fell under her cheek. “Dún do shúile. Codial go
                        sámh go séimh.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Doon dul hoola” She tried to commit it to memory. “What’s it mean?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Close your eyes, sleep peacefully, gently. My mother used to sing it to me.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“That’s nice.” Something in that visual seemed off, but she fell into quiet darkness
                        before she could make sense of her scattered thoughts.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>BREAK IMG BREAK</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Sunlight woke her. She was in the pool house bedroom, the blanket tucked tightly around
                        her like an Egyptian Mummy. Caleb’s voice came from the next room.</p>
                     
                     <p>“You gave her what?” He sounded pissed.</p>
                     
                     <p>“One of my sleeping pills,” James said, humor evident in his tone. “Just a piece.
                        You should have seen her, poor thing. Wound up tight.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Cassie jumped out of bed. She peered through the gap in the door.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb paced into, then out of, her view. “Why didn't you call me?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Because you suck at being a boyfriend. It’s your fault she hasn't been sleeping.
                        You’ve been ignoring her.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I’ve been busy.” Caleb plopped onto a chair in her line of vision. “Busy with you.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I told her that.” James’ said, his voice farther away. “She shows up while I'm asleep,
                        wearing just my feckin cacks. I open my eyes and there she is. How am I supposed to
                        know what you’d want me to do with her?”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb pinched the bridge of his nose. “I think it’s safe to assume I wouldn't want
                        you drugging her and carrying her off to bed.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James drugged her? Drugged her—and tucked her in. Dún do shúile, His words came back. Close your eyes. Sleep peacefully.</p>        
                     
                     <p>“It was just a little drugging.” James paused. “Okay, I'm sorry I drugged your girlfriend.
                        I won't do it again.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I didn't realize you had pills left.” Caleb’s voice became all business. “I want
                        them.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Whatever.” A container bounced off Caleb’s knee. “I don’t need them.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb retrieved the bottle and sat back down.</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Happy?” James asked, his back to the bedroom. “Hey, think I’m healed enough to go
                        into the house? I stashed some cash under your mattress.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“You look better,” Caleb said, “but mom will still have a heart attack if she sees
                        you.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>Cassie crossed her legs. As illuminating as their conversation was, she had to pee.
                        A daylight assessment of her attire produced a groan. Her top was more transparent
                        than she thought. Her brain must have been sleep-deprived last night.</p>
                     
                     <p>She pulled on a discarded t-shirt and jerked the bedroom door open. They both turned
                        to look at her. A disheveled James, still shirtless and in track pants, hovered by
                        the front door.</p>        
                     
                     <p>She glared at him. “You drugged my tea?”</p>
                     
                     <p>He had the decency to blush.</p>        
                     
                     <p>“What else did you do to me?” She should be angrier, but at no point had she felt
                        threatened, and she did have a great sleep.</p>
                     
                     <p>He grabbed the doorknob. “Don't flatter yourself.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>Caleb narrowed his eyes, like he was mad at her comment. His jaw relaxed, and he stood.
                        “James, apologize to her.”</p>
                     
                     <p>James opened the door. He stepped forward, then stopped, his shoulders sagging. He
                        stepped back into the room and slammed the door.</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Jesus.” He glowered at Caleb. “I’m sorry I drugged your tea, Cassandra. I’m a bad,
                        bad boy.” He curtsied.</p>
                     
                     <p>“For fuck’s sake,” Caleb muttered, lowering his head into his hands.</p>        
                     
                     <p>Cassie glanced from one to the other. Shaking her head, she proceeded into the bathroom.
                        When she came out, James was gone. She sat on the sofa and waited for Caleb to say
                        something.</p>
                     
                     <p>He smiled. “I’m sorry I didn't call. I've been preoccupied.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Yeah, I get that now.” She didn't have the stamina to be angry. Her brain felt like
                        a cement ball.</p>
                     
                     <p>“And I’m sorry my friend drugged you. Words I never thought I’d say.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Apologizing for James must be a full-time job.” She sighed. “I shouldn’t have insinuated
                        your friend is a pervert.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb grew somber. “I know he didn't touch you. He wouldn't do that.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Would he date rape someone you weren't seeing?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Of course not. But I told you, his parents messed him up. I believe in his own way,
                        he wanted to help you. James is a lot of things, but he isn't dangerous.” Caleb pulled
                        his eyebrows together. “He would never hurt someone defenseless…” Groaning, he shook
                        his head in defeat. “Why are you wearing his shirt?”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“I grabbed it off the floor. To cover this.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>She lifted the shirt, exposing her gauzy top. His wide eyes rewarded her effort. She
                        may be invisible to James, but she effected Caleb.</p>        
                     
                     <p>“What were you thinking, coming here in the middle of the night? Wearing that.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“I was thinking I missed you.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>His expression softened. He pulled her into his lap and placed a soft kiss on her
                        lips. “What did you guys do?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Are you jealous?”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Curious.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Curious about me? Or James?” After the last few days, she assumed the latter. “He
                        made me tea, as you established, and played me a song.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“He played you a song?” His voice tightened. “What song?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She shrugged. “I didn’t recognize it.</p>        
                     
                     <p>“What did he play it on?”</p>
                     
                     <p>She pointed to the guitar that rested against the sofa. “It sounded really good.”
                        </p>        
                     
                     <p>Caleb expelled a deep breath. “James is really talented when it comes to music.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Among other things.” James let the door slam behind him. He scanned her then flopped
                        onto the sofa, lips twisted in disgust. “You might want to put some bottoms on.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>No longer comfortable, she moved to get up, but Caleb wrapped his arms about her.
                        “How’d it go in the house?”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Not good.” James reached for the remote. “Mom freaked. I told her I fell, which is
                        the fecking truth for once, and she thinks I'm lying. Maybe you should go see her.
                        She tried to check out the damage and I backed away. Go let her hug on you or something.
                        Tell her I'm sorry.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>Caleb leaned past Cassie. “Don't feel bad. She understands.”</p>
                     
                     <p>Whatever they were talking about didn't sound like any of her business. And for once,
                        her inquisitive nature had been quelled. Her head hurt enough without trying to decode
                        their bromance.</p>        
                     
                     <p>She pried Caleb’s arms loose. “I need to go. I’m meeting Allison to work on an assignment.”</p>
                     
                     <p>“Wait.” James tossed the remote onto the cushion. He rummaged through the basket of
                        folded laundry next to the sofa, then threw her a pair of joggers. “You can't leave
                        wearing just your drawers.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>“Drawers?” she questioned as she slipped the track pants on.</p>
                     
                     <p>Caleb raised his shoulders in an uninterested half shrug. “When his words make no
                        sense, nod and pretend you get what he’s talking about. By the way. Was he right?
                        Cassie stands for Cassandra.”</p>        
                     
                     <p>She hated to admit James guessed correctly but nodded. Though the conversation was
                        about him, James flipped through the stations, seemingly uninterested.</p>
                     
                     <p>“Pretty,” Caleb said, “I like it.” He leaned in to kiss her.</p>        
                     
                     <p>James looked up from the TV, an unlit cigarette between his lips. He caught her gaze
                        and raised an eyebrow.</p>
                     
                     <p>Closing her eyes, she concentrated on moving her lips.</p>
