         <h4>Chapter 36</h4>
      </div>
      <p>“I have to go.” He should never have gone to Allison’s. Attempting to make himself
         feel
         better, he made Cassie feel worse. He maneuvered out from under Emily and swung his
         feet
         to the floor.</p>
      <p>Emily glowered at him. “Are you kidding? You're chasing after Cassie? I should tell
         Caleb you showed up here tonight.”</p>
      <p>“Tell him whatever you want.” It wasn’t like Caleb would believe anything Emily said.
         He
         snatched a throw pillow off the floor and threw it at her, then paused. “Chill out,
         it’s
         late. I can’t let her walk by herself, can I?”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Thanks to a blanket of dense fog, James couldn’t see shit. He jumped off the front
         step
         and headed in the most likely route Cassie would take—toward her house. After a couple
         of blocks he caught sight of her silhouette moving through the mist.</p>
      <p>“Cassie! Wait!” He sprinted forward and fell into step behind her. When she refused
         to
         stop, he yanked her elbow. “I said hold up.”</p>
      <p>She jerked around. “Let go of me.”</p>
      <p>Despite her weak attempts to free herself, he secured her against his bare chest.</p>
      <p>She settled in the crook of his arms. “I know it makes no sense, but it’s hard to
         watch
         you kiss other girls.”</p>
      <p>“I overheard what you said in the kitchen. I thought you wanted me to.”</p>
      <p>“I did, until I saw it happen. I'm so messed up right now.” She snuggled closer, her
         cheek a patch of heat against his bare skin. “Does it make you crazy to watch me kiss
         Caleb?”</p>
      <p>“It drives me mad.”</p>
      <p>She gazed up at him, her face tear streaked, and shuddered against him. “I don’t want
         to
         be alone. Can I go home with you?”</p>
      <p>He opened his mouth, intent on protesting, but she sucked the words off his tongue.
         She
         slid her fingers under the loose waistband of his shorts and yanked him closer,
         devouring his mouth. Her breasts flattened against his chest as her hips pushed into
         his. The movement weakened his knees and hardened his muscles. He secured her hips
         to
         stop the onslaught of sensations, but pressing her against him, didn’t help.</p>
      <p>He stepped back to catch his breath, hungry for more and way too turned on. It was
         impossible to avoid where this was headed and too exhausting to keep trying.</p>
      <p>“Walk, Cassie,” he instructed, his voice low, words crisp. “We’re going to my
         place.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>By the time they reached his apartment, there was a detectable change in her expression.
         Enough to make him pause. He snugged her against the wooden siding and let raindrops
         from the overhang cool his back.</p>
      <p>“If you want,” he offered, “I’ll get you my coat and walk you back to Caleb’s. Although
         I wouldn't recommend bugging him right now.”</p>
      <p>“If I texted him, would he talk to me?”</p>
      <p>“Do you want him to?”</p>
      <p>Shrugging, she tried to pull him closer, but he planted his palms flat, on either
         side
         of her head. As bad as he craved her, she had to want him back. Him. Nobody else.</p>
      <p>“Where do you want to be, Cassie? Right now, this second, who do you want to be with?”
         He held his breath.</p>
      <p>She tilted her head, eyes half-closed. “With you.”</p>
      <p>Pressing his forehead against hers, he swallowed hard. Tonight, she belonged to him.
         He
         would deal with tomorrow, later.</p>
      <p>Her wet top barely concealed what was underneath—and taunted him long enough. He grabbed
         hold of the bottom of it and yanked, sending buttons flying.</p>
      <p>“My blouse!” With a nervous smile, she attempted to pull both sides together, he hoisted
         her hands above her head so she couldn’t cover up.</p>
      <p>Her chest heaved as he fumbled his keys out of his pocket with his free hand, then
         leaned slightly to slip the key into the lock. He nudged the door open with his foot,
         the descent into the basement, dark.</p>
      <p>She whimpered.</p>
      <p>“Still okay?” He loosened his grip on her wrists.</p>
      <p>She nodded.</p>
      <p>He leaned in to kiss her. Slower, this time, enjoying how her mouth fit his, learning
         what he could do to make her kiss harder. She hummed when he stroked her lower back,
         and
         held her breath when he dipped his head, lips near her naked breasts.</p>
      <p>Too many clothes blocked where he needed to be. He hoisted her up; her legs wrapped
         around him instinctively.</p>
      <p>“Hold on. We’re moving.” He bounced her into a firm hold and navigated through the
         door.</p>
      <p>Darkness made the stairs perilous. She buried her head against his neck and, drew
         his
         earlobe into her mouth. Stopping mid-way, he gripped the wooden railing.</p>
      <p>“Stairs,” he whispered, hoping she would understand her mouth in that position—or
         any
         position—made it difficult for him to concentrate on not killing them.</p>
      <p>He managed to unlock the door to his room and laid her crossways on his bed. He
         collapsed on top of her and kissed the bottom of her throat before heading downward.
         Their fingers laced as he traced her nipple with his tongue. If he kept this up, his
         face would be buried between her legs in no time.</p>
      <p>Sure, he could make her cum; he seemed to have a talent for that. Then he would fuck
         her
         from behind, like all the faceless others. An impersonal dance, not at all what he
         wanted.</p>
      <p>He rolled onto his side to study her. She faced him and smiled.</p>
      <p>“Shower with me.” He never showered with a girl, but it seemed like an effective way
         to
         slow the night down.</p>
      <p>Cassie nodded, so he headed to the bathroom to turn the water on. She was still on
         the
         bed when he re-entered the room. Her lidded eyes drank in his every move.</p>
      <p>“Jaysus, Cassie. You are hotter than Hades.” He kneeled over her, then paused, his
         fingers on the button of her pants.</p>
      <p>“Take them off if they bother you,” she whispered, “that’s what you said when you
         let me
         strip you. Remember?”</p>
      <p>How could he forget. With a shaky breath, he undid the button, then the zipper. He
         pulled her pants off, inside out, leaving her panties in place.</p>
      <p>Wanting to broaden his view, he stood back.</p>
      <p>Her eyes widened, yet she trusted him enough to be here, despite what she went through
         with that asshole in Kansas. The one he already had the address of.</p>
      <p>Her hair folded over her shoulders as she got up. “I’m okay, James. I trust you. Don’t
         look so terrified.”</p>
      <p>Her faith in him made the sexual thoughts going through his head seem vile. He pointed
         to the bathroom, “Go in. I'll be right behind you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Lying on his bed, James attempted to regulate his breathing. When it came to sex,
         he was
         more aggressive than Caleb. What if he scared her? Scared her—hell, his hands were
         shaking. He had a naked girl in his shower. One that wasn’t his to have. One that
         somehow maneuvered her way into his life—and into his heart.</p>
      <p>He needed to think of something, anything other than her naked, wet body. Stepping
         into
         the shower already at attention seemed rude, but after a few minutes the lure was
         too
         strong to resist.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“I thought you flaked on me,” she said when the bathroom door clicked shut.</p>
      <p>Despite the steam, he could make her body out, through the muted glass. He gripped
         the
         counter. Cassie may be sort of single, but this was wrong. He should put her in a
         taxi
         and send her home.</p>
      <p>“Are you coming? I’m lonely here by myself.” She opened the door, crumbling the last
         of
         his resolve.</p>
      <p>He stepped out of his bottoms and into the shower, allowing her to pull him under
         the
         hot water. Though he kept his hands at his sides, she snuggled against him for a few
         seconds then stepped back and gazed at him in earnest.</p>
      <p>“I'm screwed. I don't want anyone else playing with this.” She motioned to his hard
         on,
         which he had given up trying to control. “Or kissing this.” She pulled him forward
         and
         kissed his bottom lip. “Which isn’t fair, because you have to watch me with Caleb.
         That
         sucks for you, doesn’t it?”</p>
      <p>He already told her he despised it, and that thought was too evil to continue admitting
         out loud. Exhaling, he gave her the logical answer. “I have to be okay with it.”</p>
      <p>No matter how she phrased the question, he couldn’t supply the answer she dug for.
         He
         would never say, leave Caleb for me.</p>
      <p>She didn’t press. Smiling slightly, she pivoted toward the tiles. “Can you wash my
         back.”</p>
      <p>When he didn’t move, she arched her spine. Her bottom bobbed toward him and his heart
         flipped. When he was with Cassie, nothing else and nobody else mattered. This was
         wrong,
         but it didn’t feel wrong, and it was extra wrong that he didn’t care.</p>
      <p>He moved her hair and whispered behind her ear, “are you sure you want to do this?
         I
         can't give you anything more.”</p>
      <p>“I know.” She turned to blink up at him. “I’m a bit afraid, but I want to experience
         you.”</p>
      <p>He wanted to tell her how much he needed her, but too much blood had left his brain
         and
         the words wouldn’t come. Besides, her eyes were sad, like she already knew.</p>
      <p>“I'm glad I'm sober,” he said, hoping she’d know that one sentence conveyed everything
         he couldn’t express.</p>
      <p>Nodding, she ran her fingers along his cheek. He kissed her palm—then placed her hand
         on
         himself—silent permission to touch. Showing instead of telling, how much she meant
         to
         him.</p>
      <p>He closed his eyes, letting the shower pound his hair around his face. When he opened
         them, Cassie was watching him.</p>
      <p>“What?” He pushed his hair back.</p>
      <p>“I love the look on your face right now,” she said, her hand still stroking. “Your
         pupils are huge. I can only see small rings of green.”</p>
      <p>He bet his pupils were blown. She was lucky he hadn’t dissolved at her feet and
         disappeared down the drain with the water. He braced his arm against the tiles. “You’re
         doing an excellent job at that.”</p>
      <p>“I like my hands on you.”</p>
      <p>“I like your hands on me, too.” Pulling his hips back, he slipped out of her grasp.
         Another minute and he’d explode into a million pieces.</p>
      <p>Her skin glistened under the water, smooth and inviting. “Let me touch you.”</p>
      <p>He spooned her against him and slid his free hand over her body. The flatness of her
         stomach, the curve of her hips. Deep between her thighs, he played her like one of
         his
         most treasured guitars, until she moaned, weak in his arms, and the heat coming off
         her
         body rivaled the temperature of the water.</p>
      <p>Unable to stand it, he flipped her around, her back against the tile, and ground against
         her.</p>
      <p>She rose onto her toes, one leg around him, but slipping into her in that position
         would
         be next to impossible. He opened the door. The next second, they were on the floor,
         half
         on his bath mat, the cold tile refreshing.</p>
      <p>Pinning her wrists on either side of her head, he sucked on her bottom lip. She squirmed
         under him. Her hips bucked upward, telling him she wanted him, as bad as he wanted
         her—and he let it happen.</p>
      <p>He merged into her with no help from his hands; a perfect joining, like he belonged.
         The
         connection so complete, he stopped moving and opened his eyes. Hers were already
         open.</p>
      <p>She grinned. “You're smirking.”</p>
      <p>“And you’re beautiful.” Nothing had come close to feeling like this. He drove himself
         in
         deeper, studying her face.</p>
      <p>Cassie gasped, lashes fluttering. His heart fluttered along with them. He kissed her
         forehead, his body back in motion.</p>
      <p>“Let go of my arms.” She strained against his grip. “I want to touch you.”</p>
      <p>Without hesitation, he released her. So what if she saw his scars, visible under the
         honest bulbs in his bathroom fixtures? So what if she asked about them? He’d give
         her
         the best answer he could, at least the bits he remembered. The scars were part of
         his
         history and he wanted her to know all about him. Anything less would be cheating her
         somehow.</p>
      <p>He propped himself up, elbows on either side of her, while her fingertips traced his
         contours.</p>
      <p>She wrapped her legs around him. “How long can I keep you like this?”</p>
      <p>“Is coinnigh mé go deo.” She could keep him forever.</p>
      <p>His thoughts would only come to him in Irish. She wouldn’t understand, and he may
         not be
         making sense. The warmth of her skin, the pressure of her hand, her legs around him,
         made speech and time meaningless abstracts. His boundaries blurred to merge with the
         body under him. He wanted to put his mark on every piece of her.</p>
      <p>“Cassie, let me free.” The words spilled out of him; his voice strained.</p>
      <p>“What?”</p>
      <p>She sounded as out of focus as he’d been. Shit. He needed her to move, now.</p>
      <p>“Undo your legs. I'm gonna explode.”</p>
      <p>Instead of releasing him she lifted her hips, sinking him farther inside her. “I want
         to
         feel you.”</p>
      <p>“Cassie.” His voice broke. What was she thinking? “Are you on the pill?”</p>
      <p>Getting Cal’s girlfriend pregnant would be beyond the stupidest thing he could do.
         “Please.” He bit his lip, hard. </p>
      <p>She unlocked her legs, granting his freedom.</p>
      <p>“Give me your hand.” He grabbed her hand and wrapped her fingers around his penis.
         “You
         wanted to…” The words came out garbled as he reached the end of his control.</p>
      <p>A few moments of silence went by. His breathing evened out. He checked her
         expression.</p>
      <p>“Ew.” She extended her palm, nose wrinkled.</p>
      <p>“You said you wanted to feel me.” Heat flushed his cheeks. That was the most intimate
         thing he’d ever shared. Cal would never believe it… but Cal would never know.</p>
      <p>A smile crept across her face. “That was pretty cool.” She tipped her hand upside
         down
         as if she tested the consistency. “What do I do with this?” She tried to wipe her
         hand
         on his shoulder. “You can have it back.”</p>
      <p>“No.” He scrambled away. “Keep it. It's a present from me.”</p>
      <p>Cassie burst out laughing. “Tell me you're not grossed out by your own cum?”</p>
      <p>“It's usually in a nice little package. Not out there for discussion.” Not that he
         spoke
         to the others.</p>
      <p>He stepped into the shower and studied her. That had undeniably been the best feeling
         he'd ever had—and he’d completely fucked over Caleb. Worse, it was almost worth his
         breach of loyalty. He’d end up alone, with no family, and he deserved it.</p>
      <p>A shiver ran down his spine. He focused on the water running over his body and kept
         his
         sight on Cassie who watched him from the bathmat. He beckoned through the open door.
         “It’s still hot.”</p>
      <p>“In a moment. I’m enjoying the show. Do a circle, you know, like a model.” She drew
         a
         circle in the air.</p>
      <p>Obeying, he turned around, stood for a second, then faced her. A basic pose—one elbow
         bent, one arm resting over his hip bone—modelling 101. His arm brushed the long scar,
         low on his left side, concealed under his Niʹ Bhrisfear Meʹ tattoo, and just like
         that,
         the smell of copper and well-water filled his nose.</p>
      <p>His stepdad held him in the empty tub, naked, shoulders flat against the curved bottom,
         the yellowed sides rising high above him.</p>
      <p>“Prove to me you love me more,” his stepdad said, placing a worn wooden knife handle
         in
         his mother’s hands. The safety clicked from the Browning Hi-Power pistol he polished
         daily. “Cut him.”</p>
      <p>His mom lifted the knife. “It’s okay, James.” She drew the blade down his side. “The
         sign of the cross,” she said. “I'm letting the devil out. When it heals over, his
         door
         is sealed. He'll never get back inside you.”</p>
      <p>The knife clattered onto the cast iron beside him. His mother's fingers gripped the
         curved edge of the tub, a constellation of tiny red pinpricks traveled up her arm.
         Her
         eyes filled with tears. She was always crying it seemed.</p>
      <p>Laughing, his stepdad flicked ashes on him, courtesy of his ever-present Jin Lings,
         the
         heater of which was one of his favored forms of punishment.</p>
      <p>They left him there, in the dark.</p>
      <p>Shaking the hair off his face, James glanced out his shower door. His tub was empty
         of
         course, the room warm and well-lit.</p>
      <p>“You did that turn really well. Bravo.” Cassie clapped a few times. “You looked just
         like a model… Are you okay?”</p>
      <p>Was he? A piece of him just clicked into place. He could recall the events of that
         night
         with perfect clarity—but no emotion.</p>
      <p>Too scared to move, he fell asleep praying his spilled blood was enough to satisfy
         his
         stepdad's anger, and his mom wasn’t getting beat in the next room. Once his stepdad
         passed out, his mom came and got him. She always did. She bandaged him up and held
         him
         on the icy bathroom floor. “It was an accident,” she said, over and over.</p>
      <p>James backed under the water and fumbled for the shampoo. After a minute, he peered
         out
         to check on Cassie.</p>
      <p>Wrinkles creased her forehead. “James. Are you sure you’re okay? You sort of zoned
         out
         on me for a second. You can talk to me.”</p>
      <p>He smiled. “Just too hot.”</p>
      <p>The amazing thing was he wasn’t zoning out, just remembering. He yawned. Like a machine
         winding down, he needed to retreat.</p>
      <p>He stepped out of the shower and grabbed a towel. “Clean up and come to bed.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Visions of his mother ravaged his brain as he crawled under the sheet. The way she
         looked at him the last time he laid eyes on her. She’d been released into a halfway
         house, and he convinced Caleb to take him there. Caleb insisted it was a bad idea
         but
         did it anyway.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t supposed to visit. But he was turning sixteen and wanted to see her face
         when
         he told her he sought emancipation. He needed to see for himself if she cared; then
         didn’t know how to respond when it became clear he’d broken her.</p>
      <p>Caleb was right. It had been a bad idea. He cried like a baby the entire ride home,
         while Caleb white-knuckled the steering wheel, swearing.</p>
      <p>His mom hung herself that night.</p>
      <p>That’s where his memory duped him. The weeks after stretched like a blank canvas he
         couldn’t get ink on. But he was sure of one thing. Caleb never left his side. </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
