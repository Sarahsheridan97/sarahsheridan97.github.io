         <h4>Chapter 15</h4>
      </div>
      <p>The cramped ambulance offered little space. The male attendant gave her a dirty look.
         “Try to stay out of our way.” His name tag read Larry.</p>
      <p>She skirted James’ feet then crept alongside the stretcher. Eyes downcast she made
         her
         way to the folded chair Claire called the jump seat. She pulled the seat part down
         and
         collapsed, glad to be off wobbly legs. With a deep breath, she raised her eyes.</p>
      <p>Remnants of James’ shirt lay mangled on the backboard. Larry sliced James’ jeans,
         cutting the material around the knife’s handle. He paused before removing the scraps
         of
         fabric to frown at her. She jerked her eyes back to the upper portion of James’
         body.</p>
      <p>An oxygen mask covered most of his face. Two IV needles stuck out of his arm, one
         connected to a saline bag. How much time passed since Ron called 911? It seemed like
         an
         eternity. God, was she really in the back of an ambulance with James?</p>
      <p>Claire checked James’ restraints before spreading a blanket over his chest. “How are
         you
         doing?” she asked Cassie.</p>
      <p>“I'm fine.” Pain ricocheted up both her arms and across her shoulders, probably from
         her
         death grip on the bottom of the chair. Her heart raced like it would give out, but
         she
         wasn’t on a gurney bleeding, so fine was relative.</p>
      <p>“You forgot to buckle up.”</p>
      <p>Claire pointed to the belt attached to the chair. Clumsy fingers replaced Cassie’s
         usual
         dexterity as she wrestled with the seatbelt.</p>
      <p>Claire handed her a blanket like the one on James. “Take a few deep breaths. In through
         your nose, out through your mouth.”</p>
      <p>After a couple slow breaths, Cassie allowed her gaze to travel the length of James’
         covered torso to Larry’s hands. The stack of bandages he held around the knife handle
         were crimson.</p>
      <p>“He’ll be okay, right?”</p>
      <p>“We are giving him the best care we can.” Claire picked up the radio. “On route to
         Mount
         Sinai ER. We have an unconscious male with a knife wound. ETA, under ten minutes.
         Vitals
         to follow.”</p>
      <p>Cassie shut her eyes. Think about something else. What had Caleb yelled? He wanted
         her
         to tell them something. A name, but her mind was blank. She opened her eyes. Larry
         was
         replacing the bandages.</p>
      <p>“He's going to need blood,” he said.</p>
      <p>Claire pressed the talk button. “Brachial pulse 110. It’s rising. Blood pressure,
         ninety-six over seventy.” She laid her hand across James’ ribs and checked her watch.
         “Respiration rate, thirty-one BPM.”</p>
      <p>None of it sounded good and James’ lips blended into his pasty complexion.</p>
      <p>“Patient in shock. Significant blood loss, possibly hypovolemic,” Claire relayed into
         the radio. She adjusted the machine supplying oxygen.</p>
      <p>Larry glanced at Cassie. “Is he on anything?”</p>
      <p>She didn't know what to say. Larry seemed like a total jerk. What if she said something
         incriminating?</p>
      <p>“We aren’t the police.” Claire read her mind. “They’ll run blood work on him at the
         hospital, but it’s important to know what's in his system as soon as possible. It
         could
         save his life.”</p>
      <p>“Alcohol. Maybe some pills?” Cassie had no idea what he could have taken. She doubted
         Caleb even knew.</p>
      <p>“Does he have any allergies?”</p>
      <p>Cassie raised her palms. She wasn't much help.</p>
      <p>“How old is he?”</p>
      <p>Finally, something she could answer. “Seventeen.”</p>
      <p>Larry clucked as Claire repeated James’ age to the dispatcher. “Check his radial pulse,”
         he said to Claire.</p>
      <p>Claire placed two fingers on James’ wrist. She narrowed her eyes and ran her fingertips
         over his skin. “There’s previous damage to the distal areas of the carpus.”</p>
      <p>The paramedics exchanged glances. “Patient has healed lacerations on his wrist, could
         be
         considered a suicide concern,” Claire said into the radio.</p>
      <p>Suicide? Caleb never mentioned that.</p>
      <p>James groaned. He jerked against the restraints, rattling the stretcher, and swung
         his
         free arm so violently he dislodged his IV.</p>
      <p>Cassie brought the blanket to her face and inhaled through. Throwing up wouldn’t
         help.</p>
      <p>“Sir. Calm down. You're in an ambulance.” Larry glanced at Cassie. “What's his
         name?”</p>
      <p>“James.” She pressed her spine flat against the seat.</p>
      <p>James turned toward the sound of her voice, momentarily stilled. Recognition flittered
         behind his blown pupils, then he burst into motion.</p>
      <p>Claire latched onto James’ arm as he wrestled against the straps. “James. Calm down.
         We’re here to help you.” His blanket slipped to the side. “He's strong. I can't secure
         his arm.”</p>
      <p>The paramedics switched places. Larry leaned over James and braced his shoulders.
         “James, you’re losing blood. You need to lie still.”</p>
      <p>“A fháil ar an ag fuck amach dom.” James' muscles clenched as he pushed against the
         straps.</p>
      <p>Claire threw Cassie a look.</p>
      <p>“It's Irish,” Cassie said, “I don't know what it means.” Since it involved the word
         fuck, it couldn't be good.</p>
      <p>“Come here.” Larry motioned to her.</p>
      <p>She unbuckled and took a shaky step forward.</p>
      <p>“Talk to him.” Larry brought her forward. “It's vital he lay still.”</p>
      <p>Cassie sidled up beside the stretcher. “James,” she pleaded. She glanced at Claire.
         “It's the restraints. He doesn’t like them. Can you take them off?”</p>
      <p>“They need to stay on. For his safety—” Claire repositioned her hands, over the bandages
         “—and ours.”</p>
      <p>Cassie touched his arm. “It's me, James.”</p>
      <p>He jerked his head to her; pupils fixed and unblinking. His fingers remained limp
         as she
         laced hers between them. “You need to lie still.”</p>
      <p>Larry fixed the IV and then took another set of vitals. “Pulse rate, 130. Blood
         pressure, eighty over sixty-eight,” he said into the radio.</p>
      <p>Thanks to biomed she caught the drop in blood pressure. She blinked back tears. “Keep
         looking at me.”</p>
      <p>“Untie me.” The words come out surprisingly clear.</p>
      <p>She frowned. “You’re not tied up. You’re in an ambulance. Pretend it’s a seat belt.”</p>
      <p>“Ask him what he took,” Larry pushed, “he’s on something.”</p>
      <p>“Did you take anything today, other than alcohol?” She didn't expect an answer.</p>
      <p>“We need to know what's in your system,” Claire tried.</p>
      <p>“Fuck you,” James mumbled, “let me out. I'll behave.”</p>
      <p>From the non-reaction of the paramedics, they had been sworn at before. She braced
         herself for an angry tirade from James, but he closed his eyes.</p>
      <p>“Patient is trauma-stripped and combative, with a decreased level of consciousness,”
         Larry said into the radio.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>The ambulance slowed as it rolled over a small bump. Then, in a flurry of motion,
         James
         was wheeled from her grasp and pushed through a set of double doors labelled no
         admittance. She swung around hoping to find someone to tell her what to do next and
         ran
         into a skinny nurse with a clipboard.</p>
      <p>The woman shifted the clipboard and put her hand out. “I’m Nurse Rosetta. I’m looking
         for Cassie.”</p>
      <p>“That’s me,” Cassie said, unable to project her voice to more than a her voice to
         more
         than a whisper.</p>
      <p>“Are you related to the boy they just brought in with the knife wound?”</p>
      <p>She opened her mouth, but the room blinked in and out of focus. Weak-kneed, she palmed
         the wall for support.</p>
      <p>The nurse grabbed her elbow. “It’s okay, honey. Let’s sit down.”</p>
      <p>Nurse Rosetta led her to an empty waiting room and helped her into a chair. She patted
         Cassie’s knee before disappearing. She returned a minute later, holding a Styrofoam
         cup
         of water with a bendy straw.</p>
      <p>The water was lukewarm, but the room stopped spinning. Cassie emptied the cup and
         set it
         on the side table.</p>
      <p>“Feel better?” The nurse sat in the adjacent chair. “What can you tell me about the
         boy
         they just brought in?”</p>
      <p>Cassie swallowed the lump in her throat and focused on the little pink hearts dancing
         across the nurse’s scrubs. “His name is James Fitzpatrick. He's seventeen.” It was
         ridiculous how little she knew about him.</p>
      <p>“Do you know his next of kin.”</p>
      <p>“I think he's in foster care—or something.” At least she got that impression.</p>
      <p>Nurse Rosetta leaned over her crossed knees. She probably did this hundreds of times
         per
         week—talking to strangers while their lives careened out of control. “He had no
         identification,” she stated in a kind but matter of fact tone. “Can you give me an
         address and date of birth?”</p>
      <p>Frowning, Cassie shook her head. Clearly, he had a birthday. “Hold on.” She dug James’
         wallet from her purse and searched for his license. It came out, stuck to another
         card
         marked Permanent Resident, across the top.</p>
      <p>“James Robert Fitzpatrick.” She looked up. “He’ll be eighteen on March fifteenth.”</p>
      <p>Nurse Rosetta touched her arm. “His address should be on there.”</p>
      <p>Cassie read it off but the street was unfamiliar. The nurse wrote it on the form,
         then
         raised her brows. “And… you're his…girlfriend?”</p>
      <p>Would they let her stay if she wasn’t? She rubbed her lips. “I am.”</p>
      <p>“You’re his girlfriend, but had to read his address from his license?” Nurse Rosetta
         raised her brows.</p>
      <p>Cassie inhaled. “Please, let me stay. I’m eighteen.”</p>
      <p>“Honey, relax.” The nurse smiled. “We have a flexible visitor policy, and the ambulance
         attendant said you were helpful.” She stood. “I'll clear you through security and
         let
         the attending physician know you’re waiting for news.”</p>
      <p>After she left, Cassie headed to a Keurig, sitting on a low table in the corner. The
         familiar smell of coffee calmed her nerves and she plopped back into the chair. She
         took
         a tiny sip and stared at the pale blue walls. Where was Caleb now? Both his parents
         were
         out of the country, for the entire weekend. An eternity.</p>
      <p>She picked up James’ wallet. He banked at Chase and owned a Discover credit card.
         How he
         managed that, at seventeen, was beyond her. She pulled out a school ID. He looked
         younger but had the same charm about him. Smiling, she put it into her pocket. Next
         was
         a Medicaid card. That one would go to the nurse. She slid it into her pocket also.</p>
      <p>Along with the cards, she counted almost twelve hundred in cash; a lot of money to
         carry
         around. The well-worn tip of another card caught her attention. An appointment reminder
         for Dr. R. Madison. M.D., LCP. The card appeared ancient—and was written out to James
         O'Sullivan.</p>
      <p>“Oh!” That’s what she was supposed to tell the doctor. Caleb told her to make sure
         the
         hospital got the right last name.</p>
      <p>She studied the card. O’Sullivan? Was Fitzpatrick an adopted name? But then how would
         he
         be in foster care? She couldn’t get the facts straight, or her thoughts. She pocketed
         the card, dropped James’ wallet into her purse, then pulled out her phone. She should
         probably call her mom.</p>
      <p>The call went right to voicemail. “Hey, Mom, it’s me. Spending the night at Allison’s.”
         Her mother would not question the message. Next, she called Caleb, and got his
         voicemail. There was nothing new to report so she hung up. Finally, she left Allison
         a
         message. Sorry, can’t go shopping tomorrow. If Allie asked why, she would make up
         an
         excuse. Something inside her refused to gossip about James.</p>
      <p>Cassie didn’t hear the nurse come in and jumped when she spotted her in the doorway.
         She
         pulled out the cards and extended the Medicaid one as the nurse approached.</p>
      <p>Nurse Rosetta examined the card. “This should help. I ran his name through the Illinois
         Health Information Exchange, and outside of his recent seventeen-year boosters, nothing
         came up.”</p>
      <p>Cassie slipped the card with O’Sullivan into her pocket. Was she supposed to say?
         Oh
         yeah, I just remembered…he has another last name. They were letting her stay, she
         didn’t
         want to jeopardize it.</p>
      <p>Nurse Rosetta’s tightened her brows and Cassie’s heart spiked. “He’s okay, right?”</p>
      <p>“He’s out of diagnostic imaging. Your friend’s a lucky guy. The knife had a short
         blade,
         and due to the trajectory, missed his organs. But it did nick his femoral artery,
         which
         accounts for the blood loss. He's in surgery now.”</p>
      <p>Poor James. “When can I see him?”</p>
      <p>“First he’ll head to recovery. We’ll transfer him to a unit when he wakes up.” Nurse
         Rosetta paused. “Why don't you refill your cup then come sit down? I would like to
         talk
         to you.”</p>
      <p>Fresh panic swallowed Cassie. What else could be wrong? Was James paralyzed? Had he
         lost
         too much blood? She filled her cup and stumbled to the chair.</p>
      <p>“We ran a preliminary toxicology screen. Are you aware of the results?”</p>
      <p>She shook her head.</p>
      <p>“For starters, he tested positive for both amphetamines and benzodiazepines.”</p>
      <p>“What does that mean?”</p>
      <p>“Does he take prescribed medication, like Adderall?”</p>
      <p>Cassie shook her head. “I don't think so. He has sleeping pills.”</p>
      <p>“That explains the benzodiazepine.” Nurse Rosetta scribbled something down. “Adderall
         can trigger a false positive for methamphetamine, but the concern is, it can also
         point
         to speed or meth usage. Is that a possibility?”</p>
      <p>Cassie stopped listening at meth. Holy crap. Caleb would flip if he heard this. They
         just watched YouTube videos of people tweaking out—and made fun of them.</p>
      <p>“Meth?” she repeated.</p>
      <p>“There was also evidence of marijuana use, and his blood alcohol level was elevated.”
         The nurse wiped her hands on her thighs and sighed. “I'll bring you to his room.
         Hopefully, he will be less aggressive when he wakes up in recovery. We experienced
         some
         issues in the ER.”</p>
      <p>Drugs and aggressive behavior. It wasn’t just the elevator ride making Cassie’s stomach
         churn. She followed Nurse Rosetta around a few corners, then into a room with two
         beds
         and a recliner.</p>
      <p>“He’ll be out of it when he gets here and will want to go back to sleep. Keep the
         lights
         low and don’t expect anything out of him.”</p>
      <p> Exhausted, she sunk into the recliner and pulled her knees to her chest. It seemed
         like
         no time passed before noise by the door woke her. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
