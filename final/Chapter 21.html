      <p>“Good feckin riddance,” James said as soon as he collected himself enough to talk.
         “Glad
         she’s not my bitc—”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth appeared in the doorway, the horror on her face an unwelcome reminder of
         how
         much he’d fucked up.</p>
      <p>“James.” She rushed to the bed. “You scared us to death.”</p>
      <p>No longer in a congenial mood, he struggled to remain still while she fussed over
         him.
         When she broke into tears, he sent Caleb a withered look.</p>
      <p>“Mom.” Caleb placed his arm around her. “You’re smothering him.”</p>
      <p>“Sorry.” She pulled a tissue from her purse and dabbed the dark crescents under her
         eyes. Shadows he’d put there. “Dr. Madison filled me in. Are you okay with what he
         suggests?</p>
      <p>Relief evaporated from Caleb’s face. He glanced between them.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth dropped into Cassie’s chair. She folded the tissue into a square and smoothed
         it. “You can’t keep going down this path, James.”</p>
      <p>The only path he wanted to go down was the one leading to his bed. Watching Cassie
         kiss
         Cal sucked all the air from his lungs. He was exhausted, and this conversation wasn’t
         helping. Rehab was beginning to sound like a vacation.</p>
      <p>Caleb braced his hands behind his head. “Why wasn’t I informed of anything?”</p>
      <p>“Because,” Elizabeth started slowly, “James’ treatment is between his doctor and
         him.”</p>
      <p>“And apparently you,” James pointed out. His stomach churned. “What’s the fucking
         point
         of being emancipated if everybody’s in your bloody business.”</p>
      <p>Caleb put his hand on James’ shoulder. “Take it easy on Mom. She was so upset, I had
         to
         drive here.”</p>
      <p>He shrugged off Caleb’s arm, bitter he'd given Cassie those pills. Then tonight, he
         would be blissfully out of it, rather than lying in a hospital bed awake, alone and
         thinking.</p>
      <p>“It’s okay, Cal.” Elizabeth sniffled. “He feels abandoned. I shouldn’t have gone on
         that
         trip with David.”</p>
      <p>Caleb paced away from the bed. “Let’s just get him home. Not the pool house. Home
         so I
         can keep an eye on him.”</p>
      <p>“Jaysus. I'm right here,” James said, “I can hear you.”</p>
      <p>“I just want to get out of here and forget this whole weekend.” Cal leaned against
         the
         windows.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth squared her shoulders. “Caleb, you're not going to like what I'm about to
         say,
         but it’s going to happen. We can’t take James home.”</p>
      <p>“Why not?” Caleb returned to the bed. “Would somebody tell me what the hell is going
         on?”</p>
      <p>“My doctor wants some quality time with me,” James said, since Elizabeth couldn’t
         get
         her act together and he wanted everyone to leave. “He's requesting I attend a week
         of
         sessions at Rosecrance Treatment Center in Rockford—as an inpatient.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth released a sigh. Relieved she didn’t have to say it—or relieved he was
         leaving, he couldn’t tell.</p>
      <p>“Bullshit.” Caleb gripped James' arm. “Mom. Call Dr. Madison. Do something.”</p>
      <p>“There's nothing I can do. James agreed to go.” She dabbed her eyes again, with what
         was
         left of the tissue.</p>
      <p>Caleb stared at him open-mouthed. “What the hell, dude?”</p>
      <p>Tired of the conversation, James shrugged.</p>
      <p>“I cleared your schedule.” Elizabeth smiled, but her eyes were flat, empty of the
         forgiveness she usually showered on him. “David will pick you up in the morning.”</p>
      <p>“Dad’s picking him up?” Caleb spun to face her, his fingers sliding through his hair</p>
      <p>“Caleb.” Elizabeth’s tone carried a warning James hadn’t heard since they were in
         middle
         school. “You're in no position to comment. What were you thinking, drinking and
         fighting?”</p>
      <p>“I was thinking some asshole stuck a knife in my brother.” Caleb kicked the leg of
         the
         bed. “You're treating us like little kids.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth rose. “Maybe your dad and I need to remember, legally you still are children.
         This is a wake-up call for all of us.” She snapped her fingers in front of James’
         face.
         “Are you getting any of this?”</p>
      <p>“Got it.” He focused on the blue of Elizabeth’s eyes, the same shade as Caleb’s.
         “Getting chauffeured to rehab by David. My life’s a feckin storybook.”</p>
      <p>“Good, because this,” she motioned to the hospital bed, “isn't acceptable. I think
         it’s
         time we try a more serious form of intervention—and I don’t want any problems.”</p>
      <p>“Problems?” James held his breath.</p>
      <p>“I’m aware of the damage you did when you arrived here.”</p>
      <p>He choked out a laugh. “Please don’t tell me you think I could hit you?”</p>
      <p>“I don't know what to think.” She looked away. “About any of this.”</p>
      <p>The accusation was sobering. Elizabeth couldn’t be scared of him. She was the only
         mother he had. Next to Cal, she’d been his most staunch defender—and he’d exhausted
         her.</p>
      <p>“What’d you do?” Caleb asked. “You were unconscious last time I saw you.”</p>
      <p>The weekend’s events pressed down on James like a wet blanket, suffocating him. He
         reached for Caleb. “Help me up. I need to piss.”</p>
      <p>Caleb helped him out of bed and followed close behind as he shuffled to the bathroom.
         Once they were inside, James straightened. His sudden recovery registered as surprise
         on
         Caleb’s face. “You didn’t need my help? What’s up?”</p>
      <p>“Mom’s scared of me now?”</p>
      <p>“She's scared for you. Not of you.” Caleb leaned against the door. “And truthfully,
         I am
         too. I don’t want anything bad to happen.”</p>
      <p>James washed his hands and tore open a package of gauze with his teeth. Edging his
         underwear down, he exposed the good size rectangle bandage which he peeled back. The
         area itched like mad.</p>
      <p>Caleb looked away, his exhale whistling. “Shit, James. You could have died.”</p>
      <p>“I screwed up.” He wasn’t too proud to admit it. He cleaned the area the way Linda
         showed him. “I’ll swallow the consequences, but it hurts to think your mom is done
         with
         me.”</p>
      <p>Caleb groaned. “I knew you were reading her that way. She won’t change her mind about
         wanting you. Shit, she worries more about you than me.”</p>
      <p>When he didn’t reply, Caleb touched his arm. “You're freaking me out, man. Promise
         me,
         no more, pills. Everything will be alright.”</p>
      <p>James took his time washing his hands. Nothing was alright. He’d always suffered
         nightmares but the last two nights, splices of his past floated behind his eyes. He’d
         woken haunted by visions—and worse—knew them to be true. Seeing Cassie curled up in
         the
         chair across from him was the only thing that kept him in his head all weekend.</p>
      <p>He dried his hands. “I dreamt about my mom.”</p>
      <p>“No way,” Caleb said, his voice light. “What about?”</p>
      <p>In his dream, his mother cradled him as his blood spilled to the floor. It was an
         accident she said, I didn’t mean it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to talk about it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Caleb frowned. “What about Cassie? Did her being here help at all?”</p>
      <p>He pushed any and all thoughts of Cassie away. “I had a hot nurse. She gave me her
         number.”</p>
      <p>“Is that all she gave you?” Caleb lifted an eyebrow.</p>
      <p>James chuckled, though it wasn’t funny. “Too sore for anything else.” </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
