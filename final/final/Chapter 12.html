      </div>
      <p>Not ready to face Cassie’s wide-eyed expression, Caleb gathered the booklets and righted
         the bench. He wasn’t supposed to talk to James about the piano, let alone make him
         play
         it. His job was to keep James’ stress free, and he blew it.</p>
      <p>He retreated to the sofa and scanned through the TV stations.</p>
      <p>“What just happened?” Cassie hadn’t moved from the piano.</p>
      <p>There was nothing he could say that would make sense, not with her limited knowledge
         of
         James' background. The door swung open, and his mother stepped in. Her sudden appearance
         sent a chill down his spine.</p>
      <p>“What happened back…” She blasted into him but stopped short when her gaze graced
         Cassie.</p>
      <p>“Hi, Mrs. Patterson,” Cassie said.</p>
      <p>Caleb walked to the window. He half expected James to be lurking in the yard, laughing
         at getting him in trouble. But that made little sense. They never ratted each other
         out,
         even as children.</p>
      <p>He exhaled. “James is in the house?” Great. No harm came from his stupidity. He would
         give the guy some time to cool down, then apologize.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth raised her hands. “He burst into the kitchen like he saw a ghost. I heard
         him
         go into your room then he just left, without a word.”</p>
      <p>Caleb held up his phone. “Don’t worry. I’ll find him.”</p>
      <p>They were the words his mother expected him to say. What she needed to hear. He slumped
         into the chair. It wouldn’t help to tell her James probably grabbed the stash of money
         from under the mattress and hit the nearest liquor store.</p>
      <p>In an exaggerated manner, he typed, You’re freaking mom out. She's in the pool house.
         Where are you? Not expecting a reply, he set his phone on the end table.</p>
      <p>A beep sounded from his mother’s pocket. She retrieved her phone and studied it before
         reading aloud. ‘I’m okay, don’t worry. See you tomorrow.’</p>
      <p>She narrowed her eyes—at him—then Cassie.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what happened,” Cassie offered, “they were just playing piano.”</p>
      <p>Caleb sunk farther into the chair. That was the last thing he wanted his mother to
         find
         out. He expected her to scream at him for his lack of responsibility. Instead, the
         anger
         on Elizabeth’s face wilted.</p>
      <p>“You were playing the piano. Oh, Caleb. Why?” She covered her chest with both hands.
         “You know that’s a trigger.”</p>
      <p>Her broken-hearted response stung worse than angry words could. “Mom, he's fine. He
         just
         said so himself.”</p>
      <p>But the fact James texted Elizabeth, instead of him, meant he wasn’t fine.</p>
      <p>His mother teared up. “I hate to think he's out there somewhere—hurting.” She typed
         something as she moved toward the door. “Don't fight with your brother.” Her gaze
         flicked to Cassie. “Over anything.”</p>
      <p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” He threw a sidelong glance at Cassie. Her cheeks were
         pink.</p>
      <p>“It means your brother needs you,” Elizabeth said. She closed the door behind her.</p>
      <p>Cassie’s face grew redder. She shrugged. “James must have mentioned he doesn’t like
         me.”</p>
      <p>That was doubtful. Like James would discuss girls with their mom. Caleb closed his
         eyes.
         He had no idea what his mother’s deal was, but the evening with Cassie was shot. He
         had
         to find James—again. And he didn’t need his mom to tell him to.</p>
      <p>He freed himself from the cozy confines of the chair and located his shoes, scattered
         under the kitchen archway.</p>
      <p>“Are you going after him?” Cassie asked. “You might need me. I helped last time.”</p>
      <p>Had he known the shape his friend was in; he would never have brought Cassie along
         to
         witness it. “Of course, I'm going to find him. And no, you can't come.”</p>
      <p>“You know where he is?”</p>
      <p>“I have a pretty good idea.”</p>
      <p>“At least tell me what's up with the piano drama?”</p>
      <p>Drama. The perfect word for it. “I warned you, nothing is easy when it comes to James.
         I'm leaving now so he can't get too far ahead.”</p>
      <p>She blocked his path.</p>
      <p>“Look, Cassie,” he began; trying to keep everybody happy was becoming more and more
         difficult. “James is already mad at me, and he gets weird around you.”</p>
      <p>She held her ground for a second then headed to the door. “Fine, I’m going. But call
         if
         you need me.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>After she left, Caleb checked his cell. He’d got smart and turned on the location
         sharing on James’ Snap, an App James hardly used and wouldn’t notice. Just as Caleb
         figured, James was in the Fuller Park neighborhood. He went back to the place on South
         Wells.</p>
      <p>Not surprising. The guy always went slumming when something bugged him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Just as before, James’ black Mustang sat outside. A throbbing baseline rattled the
         blanket clad window. Caleb approached the building. James had almost an hour on him;
         plenty of time to get into something.</p>
      <p>When he got no reply to his knock, he hammered the door with the side of his fist.
         “James, I know you're in there. Open the door or I'm kicking it in.”</p>
      <p>The music quieted.</p>
      <p>“Are you alone?” James' question came from the other side.</p>
      <p>Caleb pressed his palms against the wood and exhaled. Thank God he hadn’t brought
         Cassie. “It’s just me,” he said.</p>
      <p>The locks clicked, and James opened the door. Dressed only in briefs, he leaned forward
         and looked toward the Charger, like he doubted Caleb had come solo. A gold Saint Michael
         medallion hung from his neck and swung with his movement. The necklace usually hung
         off
         the mirror over Caleb’s dresser.</p>
      <p>“I told you not to follow me.” James headed to the sofa and plopped amongst a pile
         of
         pillows and blankets.</p>
      <p>A full bottle of Jack sat on the coffee table, next to a key ring and an ashtray full
         of
         butts; some with lipstick.</p>
      <p>“Where's that creepy chick?” Caleb asked.</p>
      <p>James laughed. “Traci? She's hardly scary, and she isn't here. I let myself in.”</p>
      <p>“What about her boyfriend?”</p>
      <p>“Ex-boyfriend,” James clarified. “He was an ass. I dealt with him.” He lit a cigarette
         and passed it to Caleb, then lit another one for himself. “He won't be back. Neither
         will Traci. I’m here alone tonight.”</p>
      <p>Caleb pointed to the keychain. “You have a key?” The fact that James failed to mention
         any of this, hurt.</p>
      <p>“This place is in my name.”</p>
      <p>“Your name?” Caleb repeated, shocked. “You're telling me you rent this shitty
         apartment?”</p>
      <p>“Traci and I have this screwed-up agreement—it’s no big deal.”</p>
      <p>That figured. James had this whole other life, but he couldn’t keep his relationship
         with Cassie private. “Must be nice to keep stuff to yourself.”</p>
      <p>“Is there a problem?” James unscrewed the cap off the bottle of Jack.</p>
      <p>Caleb hadn’t come here to fight about his lack of privacy, and James’ traumatic past
         always made his own anger feel unimportant. He focused on the medallion. “You took
         my
         chain. Why?”</p>
      <p>James looked away. “I was planning to get fucked up tonight. Paralytic fucked up.
         I
         figured it would protect me. It’s yours and…” He glanced at Caleb. “Do you want me
         to
         take it off?”</p>
      <p>The sting from James’ secrets faded. “Don't worry about it,” Caleb said, and he meant
         it. He’d done enough damage this evening. “What changed your mind about getting
         toasted?”</p>
      <p>“Your mom sent me a text. She said you guys, you know, loved me, and wanted me to
         stay
         safe. And I know you weren’t trying to hurt me. You just wanted to play a song.”</p>
      <p>James took a drink of the whiskey. “The whole time I sat at the keyboard, I felt like
         my
         mom, my real mom, was behind me, waiting to belt me with a board, or worse. She used
         to
         do that when I messed up. I don’t think she wanted to, but…you know, self-preservation.
         I had to get out of there. Sorry I messed your evening up.”</p>
      <p>The random tidbits of information James let slip from time to time, always knotted
         Caleb’s stomach. Especially when he was the one who should be sorry. Sorry for letting
         Cassie get to him today—and sorry for not saving James sooner. He studied his friend
         but
         couldn’t vocalize his horrible guilt.</p>
      <p>“Your mom is dead,” he said softly, “she can't hurt you anymore.”</p>
      <p>James nodded, but Caleb recognized the look. He was a million miles away.
         Unreachable.</p>
      <p>“Hey.” Caleb touched his shoulder. “Come back to Earth.”</p>
      <p>James shook his head. “Do you ever wonder what life would be like if we hadn’t had
         this
         high ability bullshit. When I was a kid nothing mattered but how well I ciphered numbers
         and how fast I learned Seán Ó Riada.” He took another drink, then handed the bottle
         to
         Caleb. “Shit. You're not giving that back, are you?”</p>
      <p>“Nope. Not in the mood you’re in. And, for the record, if you weren’t who you were,
         and
         I wasn’t who I was, we would never have met. You wouldn’t have my parents, and I
         wouldn't have a brother.”</p>
      <p>“If I wasn’t who I was, I wouldn’t need your parents.” James stared at his hands.
         “Maybe
         my real mother would have loved me if I’d been different…able learn faster. Able to
         help
         her.”</p>
      <p>James reached for the bottle again, but Caleb pulled it back. “I'm serious. You are
         not
         drinking this. I'll dump it down the drain if I have to.” He screwed the cap on and
         set
         the bottle on the table. “Who cares about your mom? You have my mom and me. And as
         long
         as I'm here, nothing bad will happen to you.” He propped his feet on the table.</p>
      <p>James cocked an eyebrow. “You plan on staying?”</p>
      <p>“Yep.” Caleb braced himself for an argument, but if James wanted him gone, he’d have
         to
         physically remove him. “I know what you're like when you get in these moods and I’ve
         got
         nothing better to do.”</p>
      <p>“Where's Cassie?”</p>
      <p>“At home.” Caleb stretched out and sighed. “There's got to be someone you like.”</p>
      <p>“Women are the devil, Cal.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I get all that. But you should try the girlfriend thing. How ‘bout Traci? Do
         you
         sleep with her? I don’t mean sex. I mean… to feel…” Caleb winced. He’d rather talk
         about
         screwing girls than cuddling them. “…to feel close to someone.”</p>
      <p>“We've messed around,” James admitted, “but I sleep out here. Besides, I'm not supposed
         to be in a relationship. You’re privy to what my doctor thinks.”</p>
      <p>“Screw what your shrink thinks. You need a girlfriend.”</p>
      <p>“Enough chatter,” James said, his cheeks pink. “I feel like I’m in therapy.”</p>
      <p>“You can keep my medallion,” Caleb said, happy to change the subject.</p>
      <p>“Thanks, Callie.” James lifted the medallion and stared down at it. “You were wearing
         it
         that day.”</p>
      <p>“What day?”</p>
      <p>“Our last piano class. You were leaning over me and it dangled just above my face.
         You
         kept yelling my name. I couldn’t answer, but I thought if I kept my eyes on your charm,
         I wouldn't die.”</p>
      <p>Caleb sucked in a breath. “What... what else do you remember,” Caleb asked, unsure
         if he
         should pursue it. James needed to recall things on his own, Dr. Madison advised. Do
         not
         prod him.</p>
      <p>James let the charm thump against his chest. “Nothing. Just your voice and this.”</p>
      <p>“Hell, dude. That was seven years ago. I’d have given it to you a long time ago had
         I
         known you liked it.”</p>
      <p>“No big deal.” James covered his eyes with his forearm. “Do something else with Cassie
         this Friday. You don't need to come to Smitty's with me.”</p>
      <p>“We always go there together. I planned on bringing her.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever you want.” Yawning, James piled the blankets between them, then stretched
         his
         feet onto the coffee table. “Stay if you want, but I got a headache. I’m gonna crash
         for
         a bit.”</p>
      <p>There was a tone to James’ voice, Caleb couldn’t read. The mountain of blankets may
         as
         well be the Rockies. </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
