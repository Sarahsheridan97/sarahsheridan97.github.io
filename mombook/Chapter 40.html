         <h4>Chapter 40</h4>
      </div>
      <p>As soon as Allison dropped her off, Cassie headed to the pool house. The door was
         propped open, so she knocked as she entered.</p>
      <p>Caleb sat on the sofa, a bowl in his hand. He looked worse than this morning but smiled,
         giving her the courage to approach.</p>
      <p>“I’m airing the place out,” he said.</p>
      <p>The bucket was gone, but the gratuitous use of lemon cleaner did a poor job of
         concealing the smell of vomit. She wrinkled her nose.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t smell as bad as it did.” Caleb set his bowl on the table next to a small,
         white box from the Apple store. “I drank too much last night and didn’t make it to
         the
         toilet. I was so sick I had to leave it for James to clean.”</p>
      <p>“That’s disgusting.” She eyed the closed bedroom door. “Is he here?”</p>
      <p>“Nope. He brought me a new phone, made me soup, then disappeared.” He patted the
         cushion. “It’s just as well. We need to talk about him.”</p>
      <p>She perched on the far end of the sofa. “New phone?”</p>
      <p>“Mine got broken last night. I am kind of in the dark as to how, though. Seems I’ve
         been
         in the dark about a lot of things lately.”</p>
      <p>Cassie winced. “Are you going to break up with me?”</p>
      <p>“Should I?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t want you to.”</p>
      <p>“Truthfully, I don’t want to either. I like how we can just hang out.” Caleb stretched
         for her hand. “But I need to know—is there something, anything, going on between you
         and
         James?”</p>
      <p>A million answers raced through her head, but none of them mattered. James didn’t
         want
         her. He couldn’t give her what she wanted. And even if he wanted to, more importantly,
         she couldn't give him what he needed.</p>
      <p>There was nothing going on between her and James. That was the truth.</p>
      <p>“The fact you’re taking this long to answer what should be a simple question is speaking
         volumes,” Caleb said after a minute.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing going on,” she said, then looked at him. “I like you.”</p>
      <p>The answer produced a huff. “How much has James told you about himself?”</p>
      <p>She’d like to forget what he told her. It made her want to cry and hit someone at
         the
         same time. “He was burned by cigarettes. I got the impression he’d been tied up. He
         doesn’t like to be touched because of all the scars.”</p>
      <p>Caleb cleared his throat. “He doesn’t like to be touched because he can’t handle
         feelings of affection.”</p>
      <p>“He loves you.” That she knew for certain.</p>
      <p>“I’m different, Cassie.” Caleb faced her. “I want to tell you something and I need
         you
         to listen.”</p>
      <p>Unsure what to expect, she leaned back and drew her knees up.</p>
      <p>“I met James when we were six,” Caleb began. “We took part in a longitudinal study,
         examining children gifted in both music and math.”</p>
      <p>“You told me that.” It was one of the few bits of concrete information she got out
         of
         him.</p>
      <p>Caleb put his finger to his lips, motioning for her to be quiet. “We were stuck in
         these
         music classes, an enrichment program, three times a week for several years. Even though
         I only saw him in the evenings, he became my best friend.”</p>
      <p>She nodded, trying to anticipate where this was headed.</p>
      <p>Caleb looked away. “It never occurred to me to question why he wore long sleeves and
         pants all the time, even in the middle of summer. Or why he was never allowed to spend
         the night at my house, or why I wasn’t invited to his place. So many signs something
         was
         wrong. Then it was too late.”</p>
      <p>The words too late filled her with dread as the story’s trajectory began to make sense.
         This was about what happened to James.</p>
      <p>“We were in this old section of the University of Chicago.” Caleb looked sicker by
         the
         minute. “There was no air conditioning, and I complained all the time about the heat,
         but James never complained… about anything. I even refused to play one day because
         the
         room was stifling. But James did what the teacher said, always. He sat there and played,
         with or without me.</p>
      <p>“I was ten before I noticed how dirty and how tired he looked, how he smelled bad
         sometimes. Little kids don’t pick up on that stuff, right? I didn’t mean to be so
         self-absorbed in my perfect little world that...”</p>
      <p>His words choked up and he gave her a sideways glance. “Our teacher, Mr. Deadmen,
         always
         stood on my side of the piano. Guess he’d figured out hovering over James made him
         nervous. One day we had this substitute. She had flaming red hair and was all over
         us
         about proper hand placement and other piano crap. She positioned herself behind James,
         towering over him, and he stopped playing. Right in the middle of a song—he just
         stopped.</p>
      <p>“The teacher reached over his shoulder to show him where his hands should be or what
         bar
         we were on, assuming he was lost. I knew he wasn’t because he never made mistakes.</p>
      <p>“Anyway, she reached over, and he jumped up so fast I thought something bit him. I
         remember looking from her to James. The terror on his face struck me as funny and
         I
         laughed.</p>
      <p>“He gave me the dirtiest look and said, ‘What are you looking at, loser?’ before shoving
         me so hard I fell off the bench. He delivered one good punch before the teacher pulled
         him off. I had a black eye for a week. He didn’t get to laud it over me though, because
         he disappeared. I didn’t see him for two weeks, which was unusual. He never missed
         those
         classes.”</p>
      <p>Caleb stood up. “Do you mind if I smoke?”</p>
      <p>Mouth dry, she nodded her permission. Caleb went into the bedroom, then the bathroom.
         He
         returned to the sofa with a lit cigarette and plunked down beside her.</p>
      <p>“I’d overhear my parents. They also wondered what was going on with James. They’d
         talk
         to our teacher while we played, assuming we were occupied, but we were both listening.
         I
         began to catch on, something was wrong. Really, really, wrong. Then one day, during
         a
         Beethoven piece, James passed out. Slumped over on the keys.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Deadmen laid him on the floor, claiming it must be heat stroke because it was
         crazy
         hot in there that day. He went to make a call and get some water. I stayed put, James’
         head on my knees, talking to him. His eyes half-opened, but he didn’t respond. I
         assumed, you know being a kid and all, it might help to take his sweater off. So,
         I did.
         Then the shirt underneath.” Caleb’s face flushed.</p>
      <p>“Go on.” Cassie leaned forward.</p>
      <p>“James’ stomach was a road map of scars and scabs. His shoulders and chest were black
         and blue.” Caleb ground out his cigarette, snapping the butt in half. “Worse, his
         wrists
         were bandaged with gauze, but blood seeped through.</p>
      <p>He looked at her. “Cassie, he was skinny as a rail. I mean, you know James is tiny,
         but
         man, I’m talking concentration camp skinny. Makes me wonder how he actually got me
         on
         the floor to punch me, little shit that he was.”</p>
      <p>Affection was so obvious in Caleb’s voice it twisted her heart.</p>
      <p>Caleb sighed. “Mr. Deadmen came back, took one look at him, and left again. Shortly
         after, cops showed up, along with an ambulance. My mom came in and started crying.
         They
         tried to take him from me, but I wouldn’t let go. It was awful. The paramedics had
         to
         pry him out of my arms.</p>
      <p>“A week later he showed up at my house. I was so relieved because no one would tell
         me
         what was going on. My parents gave him the guest room, but he wouldn’t use it. I would
         wake up in the morning and he’d be asleep on my floor. He refused to talk to anyone
         but
         me, in fucking Irish, no less. I learned the damn language to understand what he
         wanted.”</p>
      <p>She stared at Caleb, trying to process the story.</p>
      <p>“Do you understand,” Caleb said, “James had been abused for a long time, all the while
         sitting beside me, and I didn’t catch on. I still think about those two weeks I didn’t
         see him. Even bleeding like he was, on that last day, his parents bandaged him up
         and
         sent him to class. Can you imagine how he looked when they didn’t send him? The hell
         he
         must have been living through.</p>
      <p>“I used to pester him about what happened during that time, but he’d never tell me.
         His
         shrink said to stop asking and let him disclose things on his own, when he was
         ready.”</p>
      <p>Cassie moved closer, her knees against Caleb’s thigh. She laid her palm against his
         cheek. “You were a child. You couldn’t have known.”</p>
      <p>He rolled his eyes, guilt all over his face. He’d believe he was to blame no matter
         what
         she said.</p>
      <p>“I learned from eavesdropping on my parents after one of the court appearances, that
         sick fucking stepfather of his, shackled him to the piano and forced him to practice.”
         He jerked away from her hand. “He’s never come right out and told me about the
         cigarettes. I can’t believe he told you.”</p>
      <p>She blinked back tears. They’d shared more than words, but it was the way James opened
         up, that captured her heart.</p>
      <p>“He must have tried to pull his wrists out of the cuffs, or something. They were so
         torn
         up he had to have skin grafts. He doesn’t remember that day, or half his childhood.”</p>
      <p>Caleb picked up her hand. “After his mother was released from prison, I took him to
         the
         halfway house to see her. I didn’t want to, but he insisted on telling her he sought
         emancipation. I thought the visit would help him remember stuff. Or maybe give him
         some
         sort of closure. I’m not sure what they said to each other, but she killed herself
         that
         night, and despite what she did to him… he cried for days.”</p>
      <p>“Why didn’t your parents adopt him?” Surely, they wanted to. Elizabeth loved James.
         It
         was obvious in all she did for him.</p>
      <p>Caleb humphed. “They tried, but things kept getting in the way. He lived with us for
         a
         few years, then got placed in foster care. The family also fosters a young girl.”</p>
      <p>“You know about Maury?”</p>
      <p>Caleb stiffened. “Only because my parents talk. James likes to keep his foster life
         separate from our life. Compartmentalized is the word his doctor used. Have you met
         her?”</p>
      <p>“No,” she lied. “James mentioned she brought cigarettes to the hospital.”</p>
      <p>Caleb nodded, seemingly satisfied with her answer. “Anyway, after his mother committed
         suicide, it turned out, not only was she crazy, but she was also loaded. James being
         her
         only child, inherited all her money. A nice twist of fate if you ask me.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know much about the money part. I got tired of trying to keep up with the
         legal
         stuff and focused on him. People get lost in the paper shuffle and I’ll never screw
         up
         so bad again, that James becomes a statistic.” He paused. “Of course, he would kill
         me
         if he found out I told you this.”</p>
      <p>“Why are you telling me?” </p>
      <p>“You need to know how screwed up he is.” Caleb laid his head against the cushion and
         gazed toward the ceiling. “Cassie, you are a no-win situation for him. Wanting you
         means
         hurting me and he can’t do that. Don’t make him choose between us. He will crack.
         Even
         if we break up, he would feel like he betrayed me. It would eat away at him. Do you
         understand? You’re only hurting him more.”</p>
      <p>“You’re worried for nothing. James doesn’t like me.”</p>
      <p>Caleb puckered his mouth, like he tasted something sour. “I asked him outright if
         anything was going on between you two.”</p>
      <p>“What did he say?”</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re in his head and he can’t handle you
         up
         there. Promise me you’ll stay away from him.”</p>
      <p>The ominous warning echoed in her head. Along with James’ confession, it made sense.
         "I’ll stay away,” she said. Goosebumps splattered her skin and she allowed Caleb to
         pull
         her closer. “I promise.”</p>
      <p>“Good. Because I like you. I like that we can talk. I never get to discuss James with
         anyone.” He kissed her forehead “I need more sleep. I’m so hung over, I took a Valium
         when I grabbed the smoke. Fucking James. Every time I go into his room, I find another
         random prescription bottle.” He reclined, bringing her with him. “Are we good?”</p>
      <p>“We’re fine.” The room spun around her. She closed her eyes. It was just past noon,
         but
         she was already exhausted.</p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
