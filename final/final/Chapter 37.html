         <h4>Chapter 37</h4>
      </div>
      <p>James was the last person Cassie expected to show up at Allison’s, but the fact he
         did,
         told her more than he would ever admit.</p>
      <p>Shivering, she turned off the shower. She had no regrets—other than she was sure she
         was
         in love with a guy she could never have—and was messing up the relationship with the
         guy
         she might still have a chance with.</p>
      <p>She dried off and stepped into the bedroom. Unsure how to navigate the situation,
         she
         hovered. He got lost on her somehow in the shower, and she wasn’t sure how to bring
         him
         back.</p>
      <p>James motioned toward the dresser at the foot of his bed, his movement lazy. “Do you
         want a tee to sleep in? The folded ones are clean.”</p>
      <p>A short stack of shirts sat on top of the dresser. She pulled the top one on. “What
         are
         you wearing?”</p>
      <p>“Nothing. I can put something on if it bugs you.”</p>
      <p>“I'm good.” She wormed under the warmth of his arm. He let her but seemed sullen.
         Perhaps he wanted her to leave?</p>
      <p>“I don't know how much sleep I can get,” she said, then waited a few seconds. “I’ll
         need
         to go soon.”</p>
      <p>His arm tightened around her. “Maybe I won't let you go. I might hold you hostage.”</p>
      <p>“Why would you do that?” It was another attempt at getting him to say he wanted her—even
         though she promised herself to enjoy their remaining time together and not push him.
         He
         made his intentions clear, repeatedly.</p>
      <p>He sighed and shifted closer. “Then I could have you whenever I desired.”</p>
      <p>The words were a far cry from the—I want you bad enough to risk everything—she needed
         to
         hear. She drew back a couple inches. “This isn't a game anymore.”</p>
      <p>His body tensed, but other than a slight change in his breathing pattern, he remained
         quiet.</p>
      <p>Deciding to play along, she poked him. “How would you keep me here? Would you tie
         me
         up?”</p>
      <p>“I would never tie you up.”</p>
      <p>Tightness in his voice made her twist to see his face. His expression became guarded.
         He
         let go of her and tried to flip to his belly.</p>
      <p>“James.” She intercepted his roll, so that he was on his side, facing her. “You hide
         when you’re avoiding something. Talk to me.”</p>
      <p>Silently, he picked up her hand and rubbed her finger on the tattoos circling his
         wrist.</p>
      <p>“Feel anything?” he whispered.</p>
      <p>“I know about the scars,” she said, just as quiet.</p>
      <p>“What about them?”</p>
      <p>“When you were in the hospital, the doctors thought you tried… tried to hurt yourself.
         They strapped you on the table in case you—” Cassie struggled to recall an evening
         she’d
         done her best to forget. “It was the straps. Caleb wanted me to stay with you. He
         worried you would freak out if you woke up alone; and couldn’t move. He wanted me
         to
         give the hospital another name, your real name.”</p>
      <p>“What happened when you did?”</p>
      <p>“The doctor disappeared. I think he made some calls. When he came back, he unstrapped
         you, and dragged me into the hallway to give me shit about not giving the right
         information, earlier.”</p>
      <p>“Cassie, I need you to stop talking.” He made a weak attempt at pulling his wrist
         away,
         but she held tight and he relented. “It's not you. I just need to turn off for a bit.”
         He sounded wrung out.</p>
      <p>“Okay.” She brought his hand to her lips and kissed the scars. “Get some sleep.”</p>
      <p>She traced circles over his wrist with her thumb. Something didn’t sit right. She
         brought his wrist closer, trying to see in the dimness of the bathroom light. The
         tattoos did a decent job of concealing damage from her eyes, but her fingers told
         a
         different story.</p>
      <p>Scarring clustered around the sides of his wrist, not on the soft underside where
         veins
         are visible. She ran her fingers over his wrist bones again, then inhaled a sharp
         breath.</p>
      <p>He’d been tied up. She wanted to scream, 'Who did this to you,' although she already
         knew. Caleb told her from the get-go. James’ parents were wack jobs. All he got from
         them was a ton of cash and a screwed-up head.</p>
      <p>Her breath caught. Tattoos covered a lot of his body.</p>
      <p>Eyelids squeezed tight; she drifted her fingers along his arm. It didn't take long
         to
         locate more divots, some worse than others. She laid his arm down, not able to take
         anymore. A tear rolled down her cheek and dripped off her nose.</p>
      <p>“Cigarettes,” he said in a voice, barely audible. He inched over, aligning his body
         to
         hers. “Don't cry, angel. I'm okay now.”</p>
      <p>She met his eyes but had no clue how to respond.</p>
      <p>“See.” He sort-of laughed. “My no touch rules are there for a reason. It's not cool
         to
         make a girl cry after having great sex with her.”</p>
      <p>His attempts at joking hurt more. She swallowed the lump in her throat.</p>
      <p>“Sleep now,” he said in a pleading tone that clearly meant, don’t ask any more
         questions. A request she had no problem filling.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>She listened to James’ steady breathing as the gravity of what he exposed exploded
         in
         layers throughout her head.</p>
      <p>For the first time Caleb's crazy, protective behavior made sense. And so did the
         warnings to stay away. They were for James good; not hers. She got out of bed and
         borrowed a piece of paper and a pen from the top of his dresser.</p>
      <p>With no idea what to write, she stared at the blank paper. Even if she knew how to
         help
         him, he made it clear he could only offer her one night, and she’d willingly accepted.
         What he told her after didn't change those words.</p>
      <p>She penned, Thanks for the night, and folded the paper.</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
