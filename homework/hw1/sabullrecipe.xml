        <Ingredients>
        3/4 cup almond meal
        </Ingredients> 
        <Ingredients>
            1 1/2 tbsp plain flour
        </Ingredients>
        <Ingredients>
            50g unsalted butter
        </Ingredients>
        <Ingredients>
            1 large egg
        </Ingredients>
        <Ingredients>
            1/2 tsp vanilla extract
        </Ingredients>
        <Ingredients>
            2 sheets puff pastry
        </Ingredients>
        <Ingredients>
            2 to 3 apples sliced
        </Ingredients>
        <Ingredients>
            extra butter melted and 1 tbsp sugar
        </Ingredients>
        <Directions>
            Preheat oven to 200C. Place the pastry on a lined oven tray to that. Cut 1 sheet into 4 squares and prick all over with a fork to stop it puffing up too much and other one I choose to have it as a round circle.
        </Directions>
        <Directions>
            For frangipane filling, cream the butter and sugar together until light. Add egg and mix to combine. Finally add the almonds, extract to combine.
        </Directions>
        <Directions>
            Spread the frangipane evenly into puff pastry sheets leaving 1cm from the edges. Arrange the apple slices in a pretty petal pattern.
        </Directions>
        <Directions>
            Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with extra sugar. Bake for about 20-25 minutes till the pastry is puffed and golden around the edges. Drizzle with honey and serve with a dollop of double cream.
