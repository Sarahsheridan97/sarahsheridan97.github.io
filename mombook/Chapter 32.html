      <p>James sulked for twenty minutes, then emerged from the pool house. He breezed past
         the
         chaise where Cassie lay, sunning. She jolted upright and smiled, but he ignored her.
         He
         gave Caleb a curt nod before he disappeared around the garage. The gate’s thud signaled
         his departure.</p>
      <p>“Shit.” Caleb knotted his brows. “He’s still mad. Good thing Ronnie left.”</p>
      <p>She lay back down. “Wouldn’t want Ronnie to get hurt.”</p>
      <p>Caleb tossed his phone onto the chaise cushion and headed to the diving board. “Don’t
         let Ron bother you. I ignore most of what comes out of his mouth, and so should you.
         He
         likes to start trouble.”</p>
      <p>She’d figured that much out on her own. Still, one of Ron’s insinuations held a degree
         of truth. What if they both did?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>After supper, Cassie stood at the sink in Caleb’s kitchen. With only the three of
         them,
         Caleb, his mom and her, there weren’t a lot of dishes, but helping to wash them was
         the
         least she could do.</p>
      <p>The screen door creaked open and an overpowering woodsy scent filled the room as James
         shuffled over, to lean against the center island.</p>
      <p>“You just missed supper, sweetheart,” Elizabeth said, her tone casually pleasant,
         and
         reserved for James. “I can make you a plate.”</p>
      <p>Cassie tried to hand the wet bean salad bowl to Caleb, but continuing to wash dishes
         was
         pointless. She set the bowl on the counter and turned to see what had Caleb so rapt.
         James swung the Charger’s keys lazily around his finger, lips curved into an evil
         smile.</p>
      <p>“Mom asked if you were hungry,” Caleb said. “Maybe you should consume something
         solid.”</p>
      <p>“No thanks, Mom.” James gaze skimmed Cassie. “I caught some lunch at the Y.”</p>
      <p>Caleb looked at her also.</p>
      <p>Having never eaten at the ‘Y,’ she shrugged.</p>
      <p>“Is that a new restaurant?” Elizabeth picked up the tea towel and shooed Caleb out
         of
         the way. “I bet my cooking is just as good.”</p>
      <p>Grinning, James tossed Caleb the keys. “Text Ronnie. I’ll go to that party, but you
         and
         I need to chat.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Charger’s windows vibrated with the boom of the heavy bass, the music loud enough
         to
         make talking impossible. Not a bad thing since Caleb and James' talk consisted of
         ten
         minutes of heated words by the driver’s door. A conversation not meant for her ears,
         spoken entirely in Irish.</p>
      <p>She pulled out her phone. According to the GPS, she had fifty-five minutes to endure
         James seated behind her, breathing down her neck. That was as unsettling as where
         she
         was headed. Who was this redheaded girl?</p>
      <p>They passed a Welcome to Ottawa, Illinois sign. Caleb stopped at a Marathon gas bar.
         Needing a break from the tension in the car, she got out to stretch her legs.</p>
      <p>Caleb appeared with two Styrofoam cups.</p>
      <p>“Drink this, it’s coffee. And don’t dump anything into it.” He passed the cup through
         the open window to James; the first indication she had that he may not be sober.</p>
      <p>“How much longer?” Ron asked once they were all back in the car. He leaned between
         the
         seats to reach for the phone.</p>
      <p>“Ten minutes.” Caleb pushed him back.</p>
      <p>James snickered. “Are we there yet? Are we there yet?” He lit a smoke.</p>
      <p>“Shut up, dude.” Ron coughed into his hand. “I’m going to get cancer sitting back
         here
         with you.”</p>
      <p>“You’re not going to need lungs if you don’t back off me,” James said, but he flipped
         his cigarette through the window, to the ground outside.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>To her surprise, Illinois’s flatness became wooded and the road hilly. The odd house
         dotted the right side, boulders and thick forest lined the left. The trees and rocks
         gave way to sandy beach, and a lake bigger than Cassie expected.</p>
      <p>More houses appeared, further back on the embankment, and a line of parked cars formed
         along the soft shoulder. Caleb rounded a tight curve.</p>
      <p>“Frig this,” he said as they passed a vehicle with a smashed side mirror. “I’m not
         parking on the road.”</p>
      <p>They reached a post decorated with at least a dozen pink balloons. Caleb stopped to
         let
         a laughing group of bikini clad group of girls cross as they headed toward the beach,
         then he made a sharp right into a sandy driveway. He pulled onto the grassy field
         and
         squeezed between the last parked car and a massive, metal bin. A parking feat she
         would
         never have attempted.</p>
      <p>As always, people gawked at the orange Charger, then landed on them as they filed
         out.</p>
      <p>Cassie paused behind the open door. This wasn’t a high school party. She’d wanted
         out of
         the car, but now she wished she was still in it. Caleb approached her. In his polo
         and
         Bermuda shorts, he fit in with the preppy crowd.</p>
      <p>James prowled a few feet ahead, a lit cigarette already in his fingers. His rock tee
         rose above his waistband as he cracked his back and stretched. He didn’t fit in
         anywhere, and as a result, fit in everywhere.</p>
      <p>Cassie fidgeted. She and Ron resembled high schoolers trying to play adult.</p>
      <p>The property rose in a lazy slope before leveling off. A pale blue Victorian cottage
         sat
         at the top of the knoll surrounded by umbrellaed tables and a sea of white chairs.
         Overhead lighting brightened the early evening sky, and flames flickered from two
         firepits. At least a hundred people milled about.</p>
      <p>“I’m out,” Ron said, eying the beach where a rowdy game of volleyball was underway.
         “Come get me when you’ve devastated Mary.”</p>
      <p>Caught up in the Gatsby scene, Cassie forgot why they came. Her pulse kicked up. Not
         wanting to be blindsided, she scanned the crowd for a redheaded woman as Caleb led
         her
         across the grass. They stopped in front of a live band performing sound checks. All
         of
         them wore cowboy hats, one tuned a banjo.</p>
      <p>“Country?” she said in disbelief. Most of Blue Valley high listened to KAIR-FM, the
         local country station. It was her least favorite genre, and the cowboy hats and boots
         seemed out of place in such posh surroundings.</p>
      <p>James exhaled a puff of smoke. “Relax, Cassandra. We won’t be here long enough for
         you
         to hate on the band.” Coughing abruptly, he shouldered Caleb. “Red. Marbh romhainn.”</p>
      <p>A slim girl wearing an oversized tangerine kimono—a shade lighter than her
         hair—approached them.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Amber.” Pink-cheeked, Caleb shook Amber's outstretched hand. “Thanks for the
         invite. This is my girlfriend, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>“Welcome.” Amber smiled a bit too wide. She lowered her eyes to Cassie's feet before
         traveling upward. “Where do you go to school?”</p>
      <p>“University of Chicago, Lab School.” Cassie met the girl’s stare as she rattled off
         the
         full name of the school she would be attending in the fall.</p>
      <p>Confusion flitted across Amber’s features. “Isn’t that a high school?”</p>
      <p>“Didn’t you take some time off to travel?” James said, from Caleb’s left.</p>
      <p>“James.” Amber’s attention drifted to him. “You left us the other day before Mary
         got to
         invite you to her party. Isn’t it great we met up with your friend?”</p>
      <p>“Brilliant.” James gave her his fuck-off smile, a look Cassie had long been on the
         receiving end. “I’m gonna go check things out. Insint di, Cal.”</p>
      <p>Amber tracked James' exit. When she looked back, she was no longer smiling. “What
         did he
         say?”</p>
      <p>“That he’s excited to see Mary.” Caleb chuckled, a sound at odds with his expression.
         He
         slid his fingers back through Cassie’s. “Catch you later, Amber.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Who are these people?” Cassie asked when Caleb finally stopped, in front of the
         farthest firepit.</p>
      <p>“College friends of Amber’s and Mary’s, I guess.”</p>
      <p>“Amber’s a complete snob. She can’t have that many friends.”</p>
      <p>Caleb snorted. “I barely know her.”</p>
      <p>“How is it that you're friends?” She searched his face, but did she really want to
         know?
         She’d been so distant the week James was in rehab; she couldn’t blame Caleb if he
         messed
         around. Right when he needed her most, she bailed.</p>
      <p>“You heard the story.” Caleb’s tone remained even, “I met her on the beach, a while
         back.”</p>
      <p>“The day you picked James up from Rockford?”</p>
      <p>“That's the day.” He met her gaze. “What’s with the questioning? I like you. If I
         wanted
         to fool around, I wouldn't have brought you with me, right?”</p>
      <p>It was logical, but not comforting.</p>
      <p>“Besides, I’m here for a buddy.”</p>
      <p>“Ronnie?”</p>
      <p>He grimaced. “I wouldn’t haul my ass all the way out here for Ronald. I’m kind of
         hoping
         James goes for Mary. She’s pretty and smart. She might calm him down.”</p>
      <p>She took a steadying breath. “What do you think about what Ron insinuated? About me
         and
         James?”</p>
      <p>“I think Ronnie doesn’t know him very well—or you. James would never do that to me,
         and
         you’ve seen him at his worst. I can’t see you being interested.” He kissed her forehead.
         “Speaking of which, we should probably go find him before he… Well, before he does
         something James-ish.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>They found Ron first, on a patio chair, a full red cup in his hand. Caleb pulled two
         chairs closer. “What’s up?” he asked as he sat.</p>
      <p>“Your bro isn't following my plan.” Ron motioned to the horde of line dancing bodies
         in
         front of the band. James stood, feet planted on the sidelines, while a girl Cassie
         assumed was Mary danced around him.</p>
      <p>Pretty, honey blonde, and tiny, Mary exuded an air of confidence. She probably always
         got what she wanted, and what she wanted came through loud and clear. She couldn’t
         keep
         her eyes—or her hands—off James.</p>
      <p>Cassie hated her.</p>
      <p>“Hey,” Caleb called out when the song ended. He waved them over.</p>
      <p>“Cal, you remember Mary,” James said, “and I believe you know Ronald.” He gave Ron
         a
         toothy smile.</p>
      <p>Cassie peeked at Ron. His red face would have been more amusing had she not been so
         busy
         trying to keep her own features neutral.</p>
      <p>James’ eyes met hers, flat and unreadable. “This is Caleb's girlfriend, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>Mary nodded politely, then ran her hand up James’ arm, making it clear that even if
         he
         followed Ron’s plan, she’d never go for someone else. Ron’s slumped posture confirmed
         he
         concluded the same thing.</p>
      <p>“Let’s go play beer pong.” James grasped Mary’s rogue hand. They headed toward the
         game,
         a slight waver in his gait.</p>
      <p>“Don’t get too trashed,” Caleb said, as Ron gulped his drink. “I may need help with
         him
         tonight.”</p>
      <p>“Screw that.” Ron finished his beverage then crushed his cup. “I want to get drunk
         as
         fuck and puke on him in the car.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not drinking,” Cassie said. “I can watch him.”</p>
      <p>Ron chuckled.</p>
      <p>“I meant I can drive.” She issued Ron her best pinched lip glare.</p>
      <p>Caleb turned toward the pong table, oblivious to their struggle. “That's okay, Cassie,”
         he said, without looking at her, “Let’s go watch the game.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Bouncing balls into a cup made as much sense to her as throwing caps at beer bottles,
         but a crowd had gathered around the table.</p>
      <p>“You'd think these college guys would have this figured out,” Caleb mumbled after
         a few
         rounds. “James would drink less if he was losing.”</p>
      <p>Caleb was right. James was lucky with his shot but drank regardless of sinking the
         ball
         or not. A half empty bottle of Vodka sat next to him. He bounced another ball into
         the
         designated cup and Mary squealed with pleasure. Doe-eyed, she rubbed his back, then
         hooked her thumb through his belt loop.</p>
      <p>“I'm going to tell him to slow down,” Caleb said after a few minutes, “then find a
         bathroom. You’ll be okay here for a while?”</p>
      <p>She nodded. She didn’t want to trail her boyfriend to the bathroom. If she couldn’t
         trust him, what was the point?</p>
      <p>Whatever Caleb said to James made him scowl, but he set his drink down. Sick of
         watching, Cassie found a chair and turned it toward the dance floor. Someone tapped
         her
         on the shoulder. James stood behind her, leaving Mary alone and cross-armed by the
         pong
         table.</p>
      <p>“Mary is staring at you.” Cassie pivoted, back to the dance floor.</p>
      <p>“Let her.” James pulled at her arm until she got to her feet. “I need to talk to
         you.”</p>
      <p>Since arguing with him when he’d been drinking was impossible, she let him lead her
         down
         the hill and across the road. He paused on the beach long enough to look around before
         charging forward along the shore.</p>
      <p>She dug her heels into the soft sand. “I’m not going on a hike with you.”</p>
      <p>“Come on, Cassie. To the other side of that crag.” He pointed down the beach, where
         a
         rugged bluff towered over the water. “Please.”</p>
      <p>She peered over her shoulder. “What if Ron sees you drag me out here?”</p>
      <p>“It’s getting dark.” He grinned. “And I don't give a shit who sees.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The sand gave way to gravel as they rounded a soft bend. A rocky formation at the
         base
         of the bluff spilled into the lake, the last few stones wet and slippery from waves.</p>
      <p>James felt along the side of a boulder. He stepped gingerly onto the wet rocks and
         disappeared around the other side. Nimbler, thanks to the lack of alcohol, Cassie
         followed. She smacked into James’ back. He’d stopped short, hands on his hips. The
         rocks
         on the far side extended well into the water, leaving him nowhere to go. They were
         tucked into a tiny alcove.</p>
      <p>She surveyed the six feet of gravelly space. “Isn’t this convenient.”</p>
      <p>He kicked one brow up. “It would be way more convenient if I were bringing a chick
         out
         here to dick.”</p>
      <p>She crossed her arms, then, not wanting to resemble Mary, uncrossed them. “What’s
         going
         on, James?” She drew out the final s. “If someone doesn’t tell me what is up, I’m
         going
         to lose it.”</p>
      <p>“So suspicious, Cas-san-dra.” He mimicked her extended enunciation then whipped a
         stone
         into the lake.</p>
      <p>“Stop it.” She clamped her fingers into fists. “What’s with all the secretive Irish
         conversations? Is there something going on between Caleb and Amber?”</p>
      <p>He stared at her a second longer than what felt comfortable, then looked at the ground.
         When he raised his head, his expression had darkened.</p>
      <p>“Oh my God.” Tears filled her eyes as she slumped against a rock, her body reacting
         to
         what her brain already knew. Caleb fooled around. James would never tell, but a verbal
         confirmation wasn’t needed. </p>
      <p>James stepped forward then backward, then forward again. “He’s not interested in Amber…
         not like that.” He cleared his throat and leaned closer. “He likes you. Don’t cry.”</p>
      <p>He paused, his mouth near her jaw, then his lips pressed down on hers—hard. He backed
         her against the rocks and pushed into her, his breathing heavy. The weight of his
         hips,
         flat against hers, shut her brain down. With her arms around his neck, she pulled
         him
         tight and opened her mouth wide, allowing his tongue to turn her insides to liquid.</p>
      <p>“Fuck.” As fast as he approached her, he broke away. Jamming his hands into his pockets,
         he stared at her like she was every bit the Siren he accused her of being all those
         weeks ago.</p>
      <p>She hoisted herself up, to sit on a rock. Now eye level, she caught a shadow of herself,
         trapped in his dilated pupils.</p>
      <p>She hadn’t meant to react like that. But like an exhilarating amusement ride, James
         always seemed to knock her on her ass, senses spinning. But thats all it was. A
         momentary lapse of judgment based on hormones. Stupid, senseless, and haunting.</p>
      <p>“Why did you bring me out here?” It hurt to pull the words out of her scrambled
         thoughts.</p>
      <p>“Not to fucking do this.”</p>
      <p>He paced the few feet to the water’s edge, his back heaving under the thin material
         of
         his shirt and stared upward to the newly appearing stars. “I wish Cal would stop putting
         me in this position.”</p>
      <p>“What position?”</p>
      <p>He faced her. “Alone with you.”</p>
      <p>“What does Caleb have to do with this?” She bristled. “What did you say to him, in
         Irish? When Amber was there?” He would be honest.</p>
      <p>James looked away. “I told Cal to ditch her.”</p>
      <p>“And your job is to keep me entertained while they talk?”</p>
      <p>His cheeks reddened. “It’s not like that.” He stalked toward her reached for her knee,
         but she knocked his hand away.</p>
      <p>“Did he tell you to kiss me too?”</p>
      <p>“Jaysus, Cassie. No.” He clasped his hands behind his head. “Stop breaking my balls
         with
         questions when I’m too drunk to think straight.”</p>
      <p>“Stop drinking! Maybe then, you’d stop messing things up.” Somebody needed to say
         it.
         She took a steadying breath. “Why didn’t you follow Ron’s plans tonight?”</p>
      <p>He slid his hands back into his pockets. His top lip curled into the sneer that had
         been
         absent from their last few interactions. “Maybe my plan was to fuck her brains out.”</p>
      <p>“Move.” She scrambled off the rock and shoved him backward. “I want to see Caleb,
         and
         you can go screw the crap out of Mary. See if I care.”</p>
      <p>But her tone deceived her. She cared and could tell by the tightening of his jaw he
         heard it too. Pushing past him, she scrambled over the wet rocks onto the beach.</p>
      <p>“Damn it, Cassie.” He caught up to her, his pant legs wet to his knees. “It’s none
         of
         your business who I’m fucking. You think one night in my bed makes you mean something
         to
         me? You’re wrong. You have a serious possessive streak I don’t think Caleb even knows
         about.”</p>
      <p>His phone went off and he scanned his messages. “Amber’s no longer a problem. Your
         relationship is fucking secure. Happy?”</p>
      <p>She stepped around him, but he grabbed her wrist. “Let it go. You both made mistakes,
         only he’ll never know about yours. And that’s a good thing.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Caleb leaned against the front panel of his car, Amber nowhere in sight.</p>
      <p>“James texted me that he took you for a walk down the beach.” He frowned at James’
         wet
         pant legs. “Did you have fun?”</p>
      <p>“It was a feckin blast, Cal,” James answered for her. “Where’s Ronnie?”</p>
      <p>Caleb jerked a thumb toward the back of the car. “Passed out in the back seat.”</p>
      <p>He pulled Cassie in for a long, unexpected kiss. She kissed back, but her head was
         scrambled, her heart numb.</p>
      <p>The car horn blared. James glared at them through the windshield. Unlocking herself
         from
         Caleb, she slid past the steering wheel to the middle.</p>
      <p>Caleb started the car. Once they backed out, he laid his arm over her shoulders. On
         her
         other side, James moved closer to the door. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
