                           <p>James’ bicep twitched as the makeup artist rubbed another layer of concealer over
                              the letter’s FTW scrolled across his left forearm. She worked downward, toward his
                              wrist where his favorite tat, a depiction of Van Gogh’s skull smoking a joint, camouflaged
                              a fair amount of scar tissue.</p>

                           <p>He would never have taken this modeling gig had he known they would censor his ink,
                              and his wrist was the last place he wanted to be groped.</p>

                           <p>With a slow inhale he planted his feet flat on the floor and focused on the hum of
                              the industrial fan. After seven years of therapy, he ought to be able to calm himself
                              down—without dissociating. But he couldn’t. </p>

                           <p>His heart thudded and despite the circulating air, the room grew warmer by the minute.

                           <p>With a slight twist, he attempted to make urgent eye contact with his friend Caleb
                              who sat one chair over, dressed, ready for the photo shoot. </p>

                           <p>But Caleb, who always had James’ back, missed the SOS.</p>

                           <p>Instead, he stared down at the open pages of a discarded Cosmopolitan magazine. Weird
                              reading material, even for Caleb, but something had been off with him since school
                              let out for summer. He was too quiet, even distant, and no matter how much James tried,
                              two weeks of prying hadn’t loosened Cal’s tongue. </p>

                           <p>“Stay still, [i]por favor.[/i]” The woman frowned as her fingers skimmed Van Gogh.
                              “Almost done.”</p>

                           <p>A familiar shiver trickled down James’ spine. One he’d been taught to notice. A warning.
                              He needed out of the chair. Now. Before she asked what happened to his wrist—or didn’t
                              ask—and assumed the worst. </p>

                           <p>Slouching forward, hand on his groin, he flashed his most persuasive smile. “Skip

                           <p>She glanced at his pants but shook her head. “You’re not moving ‘til I finish your

                           <p>The air around him tightened. His body teetered weightless as his mind fought for
                              distance.</p>

                           <p>In a last-ditch attempt at staying corporeal, he doodled large circles on the smooth
                              surface of the pop-up table. Another grounding technique, straight from his shrink.

                           <p>The exercise helped until Cierra thumbed the patch of skin still sensitive from nerve
                              damage. Nausea rolled over him and a tiny whimper squeezed through his clamped jaw.

                           <p>Screw grounding himself. Dr. Madison didn’t know shit. If he didn’t disconnect, he’d
                              knock Cierra on her ass. Once he spaced out, she could do what she wanted with his
                              body. </p>

                           <p>“James. Stay with us.” With a loud sigh, Caleb let the magazine slide from his knees.
                              He thumped over it as he rolled closer. “Stop messing with him. I heard your instructions.

                           <p>Cierra selected a foundation brush from a clear plastic bag. “All these tattoos must

                              no longer on high alert. He’d passed that torch to Cal. “I’ll never be gainfully employed.

                           <p>Cierra didn’t. She tapped the serpent on the inside of his right forearm. “I do like

                              tattoo. It hid a long, straight scar—newer than the rest—but like most of his others
                              he was clueless how he got it. </p>

                           <p>He turned toward Cierra’s voice. “All the girls like my snake, CiCi.” He waited for

                              and turned toward the long wall of windows. They were high enough up to see Lake Michigan,
                              sandwiched between Chicago’s metal skyline. Scenic, sure, but it didn’t warrant more

                              up the Cosmo magazine. Are you an enabler? the cover enquired. He dropped it on Cierra’s
                              table then strolled across the wood floor, toward a metal rack containing the required
                              outfits. The first shirt tagged for him, Fitzpatrick, was black with silver pinstripes.
                              He slipped it on, leaving it unbuttoned. </p>

                              do the girlfriend thing this summer, with a regular girl. One not in the scene. Also…
                              I prefer she didn’t know about this.” He motioned to the lighted vanity and rack of
                              clothes in the otherwise barren loft. His gaze rested on James. “Any of this. When
                              girls find out about modeling, they treat you different. You’re in the same boat.
                              Think about it.” </p>

                              vacation worrying for nothing. Caleb would never put a girl over him. Besides, from
                              the glimpse he got of her, half-hidden behind boxes, she wasn’t even hot. As fair
                              as Caleb, she resembled one of his many cousins, not a dating prospect. </p>

                           <p>“Sure.” Her bikini strap slid off her shoulder as she lowered herself onto the pavers,
                              but Caleb’s attention was once again on the tiny house. Goosebumps pricked her arms
                              at the memory of yesterday’s streaker. She eyed the lavender door. “Are we alone?”</p>

                           <p>Caleb pulled himself out to sit beside her, his red spandex suit a second skin. “My
                              friend likes to sleep in our pool house, but if we weren’t alone, we’d have company
                              by now.” He flicked water at her. “I’m glad you came over. I thought I’d offended
                              you somehow.”</p>
