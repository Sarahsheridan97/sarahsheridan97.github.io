      <p>James released her to mess with his phone and mellow music replaced the heavier stuff
         blasting earlier. Cassie didn’t recognize the band, but after her last encounter alone
         with him, she didn’t plan on sticking around to ask questions.</p>
      <p>“Don’t scamper off,” he called out as she reached the garage. “Come back here.”</p>
      <p>The hair on her arm bristled, but she stomped over to where he relaxed against the
         arm
         of one of the Adirondacks; bare feet planted in the grass.</p>
      <p>He pulled a vial out of his pocket and uncapped the lid. Little white pills filled
         the
         palm of his hand. “Want one?”</p>
      <p>She wrinkled her nose. “What are those?”</p>
      <p>“Yokes.” The pills appeared incandescent under the string of overhead lighting. He
         jiggled them around.</p>
      <p>“English, please.” She needed a dictionary to talk to this guy. “I’m not Caleb; I
         don’t
         understand your gibberish.”</p>
      <p> “It’s ecstasy. Try one.”</p>
      <p>“Didn't you already get a lecture about giving me pills?” She squared her shoulders.
         “And I'm not hanging around if you take any.”</p>
      <p>Annoyance clouded his features before he broke into his trademark smirk. “Okay. Don't
         freak out. See, I'm putting them away.” He recapped the vial and shoved it into his
         pocket. “Do you have something against drinking, or am I allowed?”</p>
      <p>“I don't want to be back here with you if you're getting wasted.”</p>
      <p>“Can I smoke?”</p>
      <p>She shrugged. “Your lungs.”</p>
      <p>He lit a cigarette, his attention on the house. “Poor Callie. Hope he's passed out
         and
         not up there boking—I mean puking.”</p>
      <p>“What was up with Caleb?” The whole kitchen encounter baffled her. “He walked into
         his
         house like it never occurred to him it might be a bad idea.”</p>
      <p>James peered toward the dark, upstairs windows. “Tequila messes with your mind. I
         doubt
         Cal knew what planet he was on.”</p>
      <p>“He tried to bring me past his mom. To his room.” She glanced over to catch his
         reaction.</p>
      <p>“No way.” He exhaled a puff of smoke. “His mother saw him? Shit. I’ll never hear the
         end
         of this. First from Cal, for letting his mom catch him all pissed up. Then, from his
         mom. I told her I just had a few beer.”</p>
      <p>“Will she blame you?” That didn’t seem fair. James hadn’t forced anyone to drink.
         “She
         asked about you, too.”</p>
      <p>“Nah, she knows I'm not always the devil.” He looked away. “What did she say about
         me?”</p>
      <p>“She wanted to know if the girls had left. She didn't want them in the pool house
         with
         you.”</p>
      <p>He huffed like he found that as comical as she had. “What’d you tell her?”</p>
      <p>“I told her they’d left, and she told me to go straight home.”</p>
      <p>“Look at you, lying to Cal's mom.” His expression turned mischievous. “And you're
         still
         here. Why haven’t you run?”</p>
      <p>“Not sure.” She swallowed. “Why did you call me back?”</p>
      <p>“I want to hang a bit, find out what my brother sees in you.”</p>
      <p>It didn’t sound like an insult, but it felt like one. She wandered to the remains
         of
         their drinking game and righted Caleb’s beer bottle. “How come you always win?”</p>
      <p>Brows knit, he studied her from his roost on the chair’s arm, then pushed himself
         upright. He placed a cap, upside-down on the bottle’s top. After pacing a few feet
         away,
         he tapped the ground with his foot. “Come here. I’ll show you.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure that’s a good idea.” Akin to playing with fire.</p>
      <p>“It will be craic. Fun,” he said, “I’m not that scary.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t that he scared her. He earned her trust the night she showed up almost naked
         and he hadn’t given her a second glance. But with Caleb, she could control how she
         felt.
         Around James, she was free-falling.</p>
      <p>She sat on the pavers, facing the bottle, legs extended. Before she could protest,
         James
         slid down behind her. Her shoulders stiffened. She glanced toward Caleb’s house.</p>
      <p>“Whoa. Relax, angel.” James stretched his legs alongside hers, like Alexa had done
         to
         him. “This is the best way to teach you.”</p>
      <p>His lips were behind her ear, his hands on either side of her waist. Was that his
         mouth
         that brushed her neck? None of it calmed her nerves.</p>
      <p>“Spread your legs wider,” he whispered, his chest pressed against her spine. “You’ll
         get
         better balance.”</p>
      <p>She adjusted her position, allowing another sliver of space.</p>
      <p>“A bit more.” A warm puff of breath heated her neck with his chuckle. He inched her
         legs
         apart. The tips of his fingers lingered, hot on her bare thighs. “That's better. Now
         pick up a cap.”</p>
      <p>She plucked up one of the scattered beer caps and tried to focus, but her body hummed,
         alive with its own agenda.</p>
      <p>“Hold it this way.” He demonstrated with his own cap, but she couldn’t grip hers
         right.</p>
      <p>“Like this.” He manipulated her fingers around the tiny object then squeezed her hand.
         “We're both ciotoʹgs. Left-handed.”</p>
      <p>The lesson may as well have been in Greek. The heat of his body and the sensation
         of
         being in his arms overloaded her circuits.</p>
      <p>“Now flick it.” His voice was thick. The cap went wide. It rolled into the grass.</p>
      <p>“You missed,” she said, not much louder than a whisper.</p>
      <p>For a second, there was no answer.</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” he replied in an equally quiet voice.</p>
      <p>There was no doubt his lips grazed her skin this time. His chin found the sensitive
         area
         at the base of her neck. He rested his hands on her legs and sucked in a deep breath,
         the sensation intimate against her back, his slow exhale steamy against her
         shoulder.</p>
      <p>Neither moved. She held her breath until tension and oxygen deprivation threatened
         her
         judgment. She needed space.</p>
      <p>“I think your girlfriend wants to hurt me. This is the last position she would want
         you
         to be in.” Not that Caleb would be thrilled, either.</p>
      <p>“If you’re referring to Alexa, she isn’t my girlfriend.”</p>
      <p>Cassie scooted forward. Enough to turn and face him. He drew his knees up quick. “Can
         I
         help you?”</p>
      <p>“I'll play you caps,” she said, “for questions and answers.”</p>
      <p>“Didn't realize you were curious.”</p>
      <p>“Not curious.” She moved backward, her legs around their target bottle. “Just
         bored.”</p>
      <p>His forehead creased, then he huffed. “I'm not great with personal inquiries. I may
         not
         answer.”</p>
      <p>“Neither may I.” Other than the Paul incident, she had nothing to hide, but the comment
         sounded mysterious.</p>
      <p>He nodded, then set up across from her. So near, their feet almost touched.</p>
      <p>“Could you get any closer?” she said, “I could practically blow your cap off.”</p>
      <p>The comment produced a chuckle. “I'm taking it easy on you, Kansas. Ready when you
         are.”</p>
      <p>Ignoring his consistent smugness, she held her cap as instructed. She expected him
         to
         say something awful, but his smile didn’t waver. Using her own technique, she flung
         the
         cap. It sailed through the air and sent his cap flying off the bottle.</p>
      <p>“Beginner’s luck.” He shook his head. “Ask away.”</p>
      <p>“Do you like Alexa?”</p>
      <p>“What do you care?”</p>
      <p>“I can't think of anything else to ask.”</p>
      <p>“Hmm.” He rubbed his chin. “Truthfully, I didn't like any of the girls here. Although,
         I'm beginning to find one of them rather intriguing.”</p>
      <p>The meaning was clear. She brushed dirt off her leg. “Your turn.”</p>
      <p>“I know whose turn it is, angel.” The cap he'd been fingering whizzed toward her bottle
         and sent hers flying. He studied her a moment. “Do you like Cal?”</p>
      <p>She nodded, then flung another cap. It wobbled through the air and hit him in the
         crotch.</p>
      <p>Smirking, he scooped it up. “I think you're aiming for the wrong target.” His cap
         hit
         hers again. She waited for the next question.</p>
      <p>“Are you really a virgin?”</p>
      <p>“James!” Caleb had a big mouth. “I don't see how that is any of your business.”</p>
      <p>He grinned. “Answer the question. And remember, this interrogation was your idea.”</p>
      <p>“I am. So what?”</p>
      <p>“Don't be mad. It's rare around here, but I like it.”</p>
      <p>She flung her cap at his bottle. It hit the glass and the cap vibrated off. “Did you
         sleep with Alexa?”</p>
      <p>“Why do you blather on about her so? You sound like Cal.”</p>
      <p>“I’m waiting.”</p>
      <p>His expression twisted, a weird mixture of smugness and revulsion. “I've gotten off
         with
         all those girls. Not sure they realize they've been to the same party.”</p>
      <p>“That’s disgusting.”</p>
      <p>“That’s life.” He held her gaze. “Honestly, most of the time it’s just Alexa. That’s
         why
         she thinks she owns me.”</p>
      <p>After spending so much time wrestling information out of Caleb, she appreciated James’
         candor. Her cap clinked off.</p>
      <p>He tilted his head. “What’s with your line of questioning?”</p>
      <p>“Just wondering.”</p>
      <p>“So, you are curious about me—not bored.” His gaze stayed on her. “Your turn.”</p>
      <p>Her cheeks heated. She threw her cap, and in a lucky strike it hit his dead on.</p>
      <p>“What happened to your parents?” she asked as he gaped open-mouthed toward the ground
         where the beer cap lay.</p>
      <p>“Game’s over.” In his haste to leave he hit the bottle with his leg. It shattered.
         Groaning, he shut the music down, then paced a wide circle around her.</p>
      <p>A lump formed in her throat; she’d been told not to mention his parents. She shouldn’t
         have pried.</p>
      <p>James circled again, then extended his arm. “Don’t stress. It’s no big deal.”</p>
      <p>His hand was warm, but not sweaty. Smooth. She rose to her feet and lifted her eyes
         to
         his. He relinquished his grip with a quick jerk.</p>
      <p>“I’m starving,” he said as he collected glass, “want to go eat?”</p>
      <p>No, would be the appropriate answer but the last thing she ate was the pie she shared
         with Caleb. “Okay.”</p>
      <p>The flicker of surprise that crossed James’ face put a smile on hers.</p>
      <p>“Cool.” He set the broken shards on the table and headed toward the pool house. “I’ll
         go
         change.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The single beam of light radiating from the fridge’s water dispenser made the tiny
         house
         seem sleepy; not that she could have slept right now.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be quick,” James promised when she chose to hover by the window instead of
         sitting. He pulled his phone from his pocket and handed it to her. “Password’s the
         year
         of my car, 1969. Check out my playlist. Let me know if you like anything.” He left
         the
         bathroom door ajar and a second later the shower started.</p>
      <p>She propped her elbows on the windowsill and punched the numbers into James’ cell.
         An
         eagle-like bird appeared with the word Provisionals, followed by several apps. He
         gave
         her his actual password. She set the device on the ledge.</p>
      <p>Standing in the pool house with the sound of the shower and the constant, comforting
         hum
         of the air conditioner, the night seemed peaceful. Tranquil not suffocating, the way
         it
         felt in her bedroom.</p>
      <p>The bathroom door creaked. James slipped into the bedroom, a towel around his hips.
         A
         minute later, he emerged wearing ripped skinny jeans and an undone button-down shirt.
         His swimming trunks may have exposed more skin, but his tattoos seemed extra enticing
         half-hidden under the doaned fly of his jeans.</p>
      <p>Her stomach flipped, but she grunted in disgust. “In case you didn’t realize, shirts
         have buttons for a reason. And your pants couldn't get any lower if you pulled them
         off.”</p>
      <p>“Button me up if it bothers you.” The suggestion sounded wicked. He stepped closer,
         bringing the fresh scent of soap. His mouth twitched. “You always appear so shocked,
         angel.”</p>
      <p>She pushed him away. “Stop flirting.”</p>
      <p>“Is that what I'm doing? You're the one staring at my crotch.”</p>
      <p>“I am not.” God, she had been. “I just wondered what it looks like below your
         waistband.”</p>
      <p>James laughed.</p>
      <p>“The tattoo,” she replied quickly.</p>
      <p>“I'd offer to show you what it looks like, but that would be all shades of
         inappropriate.” He slipped his bare feet into a pair of black Converse. “You do
         remember, you’re my brother’s girlfriend? Which also means I wouldn't be flirting
         with
         you.”</p>
      <p>“I know whose girlfriend I am. It's just you're usually so shitty when Caleb’s
         around.”</p>
      <p>“Cal's asleep, and I don't want to sit here by myself. I can be an asshole tomorrow
         if
         you prefer me like that.” Hair draped his face as he buttoned his shirt. He cuffed
         his
         sleeves and cocked his head. “Better?</p>
      <p>“Yes.” It wasn’t. Half-naked—fully-clothed; it made no difference to the quiver in
         her
         stomach.</p>
      <p>He jingled keys from a hook and held the pool house door open. Shit, why hadn't she
         considered they might be driving somewhere?</p>
      <p>“Jaysus,” he said, “what’s wrong now?”</p>
      <p>“Are you okay to drive?”</p>
      <p>“Of course, I am. Contrary to popular belief, I don't have a death wish.”</p>
      <p>She didn’t move.</p>
      <p>His eyes narrowed, then he blinked. “I’m not plastered. Get in my car, and I'll tell
         you
         how I win at caps—and why I'm sober.”</p>
      <p>Relenting, she snatched his phone off the sill and waved it in the air. “Don’t you
         want
         this?”</p>
      <p>“Keep it in your purse.” He grinned. “I don’t need it. I’m playing with you right
         now.
