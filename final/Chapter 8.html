      </div>
      <p>From the passenger window of James’ Mustang, it looked like he brought her to a huge
         skate park. High overhead lighting lit the area like a ballfield; there was no
         restaurant in sight.</p>
      <p>James slowed past a trio of guys drumming upside-down plastic containers, then pulled
         into one of the few available spots. A group of kids shuffled over so he could park.
         They nodded in unison as Cassie got out of the car. Most of them were dressed in black
         but one of the girls had bright pink hair. Another girl had no hair and wore a fake
         snake necklace.</p>
      <p>The snake moved and Cassie gasped.</p>
      <p>There were some kids in Blue Valley that pushed the fashion limits of the suburban
         high
         school, but nothing like this.</p>
      <p>James grabbed her hand and headed down a walkway to the underside of a tall vertical
         jump. She didn’t notice the door till it opened. A man with a tag that read security
         stood inside the entrance.</p>
      <p>“Cal and I used to hang here all the time,” James said as they passed through a metal
         detector and proceeded down a steep incline.</p>
      <p>The floor leveled into a cavernous restaurant, its noise and smell in line with a
         school
         cafeteria. James sped through the sea of tables. They rounded two narrow corners and
         entered a less populated room, lit with flashing neon signs. He brought her to the
         back
         corner, released her hand, and slid onto the red velvet bench seat, facing the wall.</p>
      <p>Cassie sat across from him and clasped her hands. Going somewhere with James had to
         be
         the stupidest thing she’d done since moving to Chicago.</p>
      <p>She peeked over his shoulder. “That tall, skinny guy had vampire fangs.” He smiled
         as
         she passed, and his gaze lingered on her from three booths over. “I’m sure his teeth
         had
         points. Or maybe it was a lip ring.”</p>
      <p>“I saw him smile at you. They’re fangs.” He watched her. “You look surprised by all
         this. Haven’t you heard of goth? I bet you don't even know what emo is?”</p>
      <p>“I do so know what emo is. I lived in Kansas, not under a rock.”</p>
      <p>James leaned forward. “Unless you want to see me get into a fight, I suggest you stop
         eyeballing that fanged arse.”</p>
      <p>“Is that why we're sitting back here? If these people scare you, why’d you bring me
         here?”</p>
      <p>“I'm not scared—and you shouldn’t be, either. We're back here because I want to keep
         this low-key.”</p>
      <p>“This is an odd place to take me if you wanted privacy. We just paraded past a million
         people.”</p>
      <p>He bumped her hand. “I'm counting on the masses to keep me out of trouble.”</p>
      <p>Not wanting to hazard a guess as to what he meant by trouble, she waited for him to
         continue. But he only reclined against the seat, his narrowed eyes focused on her.</p>
      <p>The waitress came over. Nodding politely, he ordered two coffees and two breakfast
         specials.</p>
      <p>“I usually get to pick out my food,” she said, “In case you haven’t noticed, I’m not
         eight.”</p>
      <p>“I noticed,” he answered in the thoughtful tone she was beginning to connect to his
         personality. “I usually order when I bother to take a girl out. They never care. They’re
         more interested in the itinerary than the food.”</p>
      <p>“What kind of girls do you take out?” No doubt Anorexic Alexa. The itinerary probably
         included knocking the plates off the table so they could screw.</p>
      <p>He pointed to their waitress, visible through the doorway. “I’ll go tell her if you
         want
         something different. And I promise to keep mum next time we're in a restaurant
         together.”</p>
      <p>It would be worth changing her order to watch him make nice with the waitress, but
         the
         breakfast special sounded good. “It's okay,” she said, “you guessed right. I would
         have
         gotten that, anyway.”</p>
      <p>The sharp edges of his features softened. His top lip twitched, and he broke into
         a
         genuine smile. One she mirrored.</p>
      <p>“You have a great smile.” She meant it as a compliment, but as soon as she said it,
         he
         scowled—also not a bad look.</p>
      <p>The waitress delivered their coffee. Cassie added cream and sugar. “I'm still waiting
         for an explanation about how you win at caps.”</p>
      <p>“Here's the thing.” James’ gaze skirted the room. “You can't say anything, or Cal
         will
         kill me. Agreed?”</p>
      <p>She nodded.</p>
      <p>“I'm a good shot, and…I fake drinking.” His cheeks turned a rosy hue, harmonious with
         the neon lips, hung over his head.</p>
      <p>“You fake drinking? Is that even possible?”</p>
      <p>“I take the first few shots; then, when my opponent gets too drunk to notice, which
         happens because I'm a good shot, I don't take every hit.”</p>
      <p>“Really.” She laughed. “You cheat.”</p>
      <p>“I’m good, so it's not cheating, and sometimes I do drink. But occasionally, like
         tonight, when I want to do other things, I don't feel like getting ossified.”</p>
      <p>Like tonight. The words echoed in her head. She sipped her coffee. “That's still not
         fair.</p>
      <p>“Poor little buttercup. Who told you life is fair?” He laid his spoon gracefully across
         one side of his cup where it teeter-tottered toward equilibrium.</p>
      <p>She attempted the same thing. Her spoon plopped into her cup and a few drops of hot
         coffee splashed onto her arm. She tried again. The spoon tumbled to the table.</p>
      <p>James snickered but remained focused on his trick.</p>
      <p>She flipped her spoon at his cup. Both utensils clattered onto the metal tabletop.</p>
      <p>“Hey.” He looked up, his eyes wide. “What was that for?”</p>
      <p>“Who is the most important person in your life? I knocked your spoon off. You have
         to
         answer.”</p>
      <p>“Never said I wanted to keep playing your silly game.” He placed the spoon in his
         cup.
         “You ask me the most fucked-up questions.”</p>
      <p>“Come on.” She guessed the answer but enjoyed watching him squirm. “Who?”</p>
      <p>“Caleb,” he answered. “And not in that way. So that better not be your next brilliant
         inquiry.”</p>
      <p>“What about his mom? You refer to her as Mom also, and I happen to know you haven't
         been
         officially adopted.”</p>
      <p>His focus shifted back to his cup. “Bonus points for you. I consider her my mom. Happy?”
         A few seconds passed before he lifted his eyes. “Do I get another turn?”</p>
      <p>“Of course.” She fidgeted under the weight of his stare and waited.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, now. How much do you like Cal?”</p>
      <p>Caleb seemed distant at times, and more than a little secretive, but he was sweet
         and
         treated her decently. “More than any guy I've met,” she said, “why are you so suspicious
         of my intentions?”</p>
      <p>“Distrustful by nature, I guess.” He picked up his cup.</p>
      <p>“How many girls have you slept with?” She fired off another question while he drank.</p>
      <p>“No idea.” He set the cup down and raised his hands in surrender. “Too many to keep
         track of. Not that any are worth remembering.”</p>
      <p>“Why?” His continued compliance amazed her.</p>
      <p>“Why do I sleep with so many chicks?” He waited for her nod. “Because I can.” He
         shrugged. “Do you ask Cal these types of things?”</p>
      <p>“Ha. That was your question, and my answer is, no. I have other things to talk to
         Caleb
         about. My turn again.” He appeared bemused so she continued. “How many girls has Caleb
         slept with?”</p>
      <p>“Ask him that. Ask me something I can answer.”</p>
      <p>“Why do you always wear shirts with collars and sleeves?”</p>
      <p>“I like my arms covered.”</p>
      <p>“Why?” The word tumbled out before she realized it was a question.</p>
      <p>He stirred his black coffee. “Just do.”</p>
      <p>“You mean you don't wear them to look sexy and drive girls crazy?”</p>
      <p>“You think I look sexy?” He sounded pleased.</p>
      <p>Oh God. Running unfiltered, she practically admitted she thought he was hot. He leaned
         over the table and stared into her eyes. “Do you find me attractive?”</p>
      <p>A faint guitar riff rose from her purse—not her ringtone. The music ended and started
         again.</p>
      <p>“Plan on answering that?” he asked.</p>
      <p>“You want me to answer your phone?”</p>
      <p>His arm brushed hers as he stretched across the table and retrieved her purse from
         the
         seat. He plopped it in front of her. “By all means.”</p>
      <p>The display read Alexa. Cassie flashed the screen at him, but he only shrugged. She
         hit
         accept. “Hello.”</p>
      <p>“Who the hell is this?” Alexa demanded.</p>
      <p>Cassie held the phone out. “Your girlfriend sounds mad.”</p>
      <p>“Tell her I don't want to talk to her.” James grinned. “Tell her I'm busy with you.”</p>
      <p>“I can't say that.” She pressed her finger firmly over the mouthpiece and thrust the
         device toward him. “Please.”</p>
      <p>He obliged her by taking it. “What's up? No. You’re wrong.” He made a face into the
         phone. “I'm having an early breakfast with Cassie. Yes, just her and me.”</p>
      <p>The waitress appeared with their food and refilled their water.</p>
      <p>“I have to go now. Catch you later.” He laid the phone down and jabbed his toast into
         his egg yolk. “You're right, she’s pissed. If she knew where I was, she’d show up.
         She
         seems to be as curious about you as you are about her.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe you shouldn't sleep with girls you don’t have feelings for.”</p>
      <p>“I don't have feelings for any girl.”</p>
      <p>“I'm just saying.” She swallowed her hash browns with a drink of water. “This is an
         assumption, but you might enjoy sex more if you actually liked the person you slept
         with.”</p>
      <p>“It's just sex, angel. I don't want anything else. I'm not capable of anything
         else.”</p>
      <p>“Why do you insist on calling me angel? It’s like you go out of your way to piss people
         off.”</p>
      <p>“I had this dream.” He picked up his bacon with his fingers. “You were holding my
         hand,
         saving me from something. I knew no matter what, I'd be okay because I’d found my
         guardian angel.”</p>
      <p>For someone who mocked emotional involvement, that was a romantic notion. She stared
         at
         him. “Really?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, really. I don't remember anything else, so don't ask.”</p>
      <p>“That wasn't a dream.” The memory brought the corner of her mouth up, even though
         the
         night she’d gone with Caleb to rescue James had been totally messed up.</p>
      <p>Creases appeared in James’ forehead. He set his fork down. “What are you going on
         about?”</p>
      <p>“Hi, James.” A girl, the tips of her hair blue, slid into the booth and snuggled up
         to
         him. Her dark-haired friend, a girl with dreads plopped next to Cassie. “I thought
         that
         was you all the way back here.”</p>
      <p>“Hey girls.” The welcome lacked his normal, lecherous quality. He retreated against
         the
         seat, his gaze still on Cassie. “How's your summer going?”</p>
      <p>“Great,” the one with the blue hair answered. Her eyes flicked to Cassie also.</p>
      <p>James dropped his stare. “This is Caleb’s girlfriend, Cassandra.”</p>
      <p>“Hi,” Cassie said.</p>
      <p>Both girls gave her a curious smile before their attention swung back to James. “I
         think
         I saw you in Teen Vogue,” said the girl with the dreads, “was it you?”</p>
      <p>Cassie laughed. Teen Vogue. They must be high.</p>
      <p>“Excuse me.” James gave the one beside him clear indication he wanted to exit the
         booth.
         “Cassie, I’m gonna go pay so we can get out of here.”</p>
      <p>The girls followed him to the cashier. He gave Cassie a tiny shrug from across the
         room,
         an obvious cue he wished his entourage would disappear.</p>
      <p>She eyeballed him as he approached the table. “Teen Vogue?”</p>
      <p>“It's a school thing. You'll see in the fall.”</p>
      <p>“That sounds fun.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, it's great craic. Let’s go.” He glanced around then reached for her hand.</p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
