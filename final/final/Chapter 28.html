         <h4>Chapter 28</h4>
      </div>
      <p>In the middle of his shower, James’ phone went off. He shook his hand free of water
         and
         scrambled for it before it vibrated off the tank, into the toilet.</p>
      <p>He hit speaker without checking the display. “Talk.”</p>
      <p>Caleb chuckled on the other end. “So polite.”</p>
      <p>In an instant, he slid across the tiled floor to peek through the bathroom door. His
         bed
         was an empty mass of rumpled sheets. Cassie was gone.</p>
      <p>He breathed a sigh of relief. Sleeping next to her had been frustrating, but it was
         a
         dick move to trap her on his bed. He never chased Cal’s chicks and didn’t plan to
         start
         now.</p>
      <p>“Cal. Still there?” He closed the toilet lid and sat down.</p>
      <p>“You alone?” Caleb asked after a short pause.</p>
      <p>“Completely.” Blinking, he rubbed soap out of his left eye. “I’m at home.”</p>
      <p>“Good. I’m meeting Cassie in an hour, and you have to be there.”</p>
      <p>He didn’t want to see either of them. “Why?”</p>
      <p>“I stood her up. Remember? Red across town?” Caleb sighed. “James, are you following
         me?
         Last night’s party… Are you all right?”</p>
      <p>“I remember. Fuck.” Why did everyone assume he was having a mental breakdown if he
         didn't answer right away? Shivering, he reached into the shower and adjusted the water
         to hot. “Text me your location.”</p>
      <p>This had bad scene written all over it, and he had no one to blame but himself.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“You owe me eighteen bucks.” James plunked into the chair across from Caleb and sipped
         his coffee.</p>
      <p>Caleb pulled his wallet out. “What for?”</p>
      <p>“Taxi.”</p>
      <p>“Something wrong with your car?” Caleb tossed a twenty onto the table.</p>
      <p>“It would have taken time to park, and I got the impression you wanted me here fast.
         Twenty minutes ago, I was in my shower. That's fast.” Having been joking about the
         cash,
         he pushed the bill toward Caleb. “Where were you yesterday?”</p>
      <p>Caleb put the money back in his wallet and grinned. “I got to know Red really, really
         well. The rug matches the drapes, by the way.”</p>
      <p>“You shagged her?” Until now, he hadn’t been sure Cal would go through with it.</p>
      <p>“Shh.” Caleb looked around. “Three times, bro. Although, the last time was, in your
         words, feckin futile.”</p>
      <p>Unsure of what his expression should project, James leaned back. Cal appeared pleased,
         but congratulations seemed a stretch.</p>
      <p>“You’re breaking up with Cassie, then?” he asked. That would make it easier to avoid
         her. Problem solved.</p>
      <p>“No. I’m not breaking up with her. What’s with you?” Suspicion narrowed Caleb’s eyes.
         A
         look James wasn’t used to being on the receiving end of.</p>
      <p>He folded his arms in front of him. “What do you mean?”</p>
      <p>“You keep asking about Cassie.”</p>
      <p>“I do?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, dude. At the beach, and just now. It never bothered you before when I wasn’t
         faithful.”</p>
      <p>Cal was right. They used to laugh about his affairs. James twisted his Cubs hat around,
         the brim low over his eyes and glowered. How in the hell had he developed this annoying,
         moral rectitude toward Cal’s girlfriend?</p>
      <p>“So, what’s your problem?” Caleb’s frown deepened. You've done two girls—at the same
         time.”</p>
      <p>True. On more than one occasion. James laced his fingers behind his head. “But I wasn’t
         supposed to be into one of them. For me, it’s just sex. All the time. You said you
         wanted a girlfriend this summer. Something serious.”</p>
      <p>“I do want a girlfriend.” Caleb sounded exasperated. “I’m waiting for her to change
         her
         mind back, into wanting to sleep with me again. Isn't that what you’re supposed to
         do in
         a relationship? Wait?”</p>
      <p>The entire conversation was ludicrous, and the fact that he had to pull it out of
         Cal
         was infuriating. “I'm pretty sure, in a relationship, you're not supposed to screw
         another girl because you're trying to be a gentleman with the first one. Even I
         understand that much, Cal.” He sighed. “Graʹ leat iʹ?”</p>
      <p>“Do I love her?” Caleb issued a noncommittal shrug. “It’s different with her. Are
         you
         okay with this?”</p>
      <p>“Since when do you need my permission?”</p>
      <p>“I know you think she’s a pain in the ass.” Caleb shook his head. “Just get any idea
         that I'm putting Cassie above you, out of your head. I would never do that. Not with
         any
         chick.”</p>
      <p>That was how he’d felt. Left behind for the first girl that might be worthy of being
         abandoned for.</p>
      <p>“Then why do you keep me in the dark when it comes to her?” The question burnt him
         for
         some time, but he never planned to ask it. He fought to read Caleb’s reaction, but
         everything blurred. His heart pounded, his muscles twitched, and the metallic taste
         of
         cortisol filled his mouth.</p>
      <p>He traced the rim of his cup with his thumb, his thoughts a slippery, evasive mess.
         No
         matter how he examined the situation, the ground beneath his feet caved in. He was
         mad
         at Cal for having Cassie, mad at himself for wanting her, and most confusing, mad
         at her
         for consuming all Cal’s attention.</p>
      <p>Unsure how much time passed, he looked up. All color had drained from Caleb’s
         cheeks.</p>
      <p>“James. I was talking to you. Stay with me, dude. It freaks me out when you detach
         like
         that.”</p>
      <p>“I'm here, man. Relax.”</p>
      <p>Caleb sighed. “So, you feel like you’re in the dark—”</p>
      <p>“Don't pull that counseling bullshit on me.” James bristled. “I don't feel like I’m
         in
         the dark, it’s a feckin fact. What’s the deal with you two? Your lips are sealed when
         it
         comes to her. I’m an outsider.”</p>
      <p>For a second Caleb looked away, then he nodded. “I wanted to have a secret from you.
         I'm
         not sure why, but I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p>James leaned back, his chair on its hind legs. He knew why. Because, despite the whole
         Red travesty, and for whatever reason, Caleb wanted Cassie and didn’t want to admit
         it.</p>
      <p>He wanted to throw his drink.</p>
      <p>“Okay,” Caleb’s voice sounded miles away and on high alert, “I’ll tell you everything
         from now on.”</p>
      <p>James gripped the edge of the table and let his thoughts jumble. He wasn’t supposed
         to
         retreat into his head, but the possibility of throwing his cup was too real if he
         came
         back to Earth right now.</p>
      <p>“Hey, guys.”</p>
      <p>Cassie’s voice brought him back.</p>
      <p>Her lips were pressed tight, her eyes large. But then, so were Caleb's.</p>
      <p>He wanted to tell Cal he was okay. “Angel,” came out instead.</p>
      <p>Cassie’s cheeks pinkened. She fumbled with her purse.</p>
      <p>Caleb turned. “Hey, Cassie. Thanks for meeting us.” Jumping to attention, he hugged
         her
         then pulled out a chair. “I’ll go get your coffee.” He mouthed 'be nice' over her
         head
         before leaving.</p>
      <p>“Great,” James said when she pulled out her phone. “You can't even look at me.”</p>
      <p>“What are you doing here?” she asked in an exaggerated whisper.</p>
      <p>“You have a problem with me being here?” It wasn’t funny, but he chuckled. “You didn’t
         have a problem with me this morning.”</p>
      <p>Her expression withered, making him regret his words. “Cal called. He figured you’d
         be
         pissed at being stood up and wanted me here as a buffer.”</p>
      <p>“Did he tell you where he was?”</p>
      <p>James eyed the coffee line; Cal would be awhile. He shook his head. “Nope.” And since
         it
         sounded like she needed a reminder, he added, “He has no idea where you were either.
         I'd
         like to keep it that way.”</p>
      <p>She sucked in her top lip and nodded. “I'm sorry about last night. The whole puke
         thing.
         I know you were being nice because you felt sorry for me. I’ve decided it would be
         in
         both our best interests to give you an out.”</p>
      <p>“An out?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah.” She watched him, closely. “You can stop pretending to like me.”</p>
      <p>James set his coffee down and feigned a yawn. “That’s a bloody relief.”</p>
      <p>“So we can just go back to being…” She dipped her head, “…frenemies? Or whatever we
         were.”</p>
      <p>Cal had reached the register. “Caleb knows what you drink?”</p>
      <p>“Yes. Sure. We get coffee almost every day. So, are we friends… sort of?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, frenemies.” Whatever the hell that was. Was she fucking serious? He scrolled
         through his contacts. There had to be some female close by. One who could meet him
         right
         now. Someone to erase the visual of Cal and her having their morning coffee, talking
         like a lovely married couple.</p>
      <p>Caleb joined them. He handed Cassie a tall, iced drink covered in whipped cream. “Just
         how you like it.”</p>
      <p>“How very sweet of you, Cal,” James said, concentrating on his phone.</p>
      <p>Caleb placed his arm around Cassie. “Did you miss me last night? I’m sorry I couldn’t
         make it.”</p>
      <p>James dropped his phone onto the table and rolled his eyes. “Oh, Cassie. Did you miss
         me, baby?” he mimicked, cutting off Cassie’s reply.</p>
      <p>His stomach hurt. Unable to sit still, he picked up a couple of stir sticks and tapped
         out a percussion solo on the cup lid.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” Caleb sounded pissed. “James!”</p>
      <p>Groaning, James tossed the sticks on the table. They slid across the surface, stopping
         against Cassie’s cup.</p>
      <p>She stared at him, open-mouthed.</p>
      <p>“Don’t worry, Cassandra.” He picked up his phone. “I’ll be out of your hair soon.”</p>
      <p>Caleb cleared his throat, something he did when he was stressed. “You don’t have to
         go
         anywhere. Hang with us…” He cleared his throat again. “What do you want to do,
         Cassie?”</p>
      <p>She leaned forward and whispered something in Caleb’s ear; the secret punctuated with
         tiny laugh and a slight blush. Her hand moved under the table and Caleb’s brows shot
         up.</p>
      <p>It was a move James would have expected from Alexa, not Cassie. He pushed out of his
         chair. “I can't believe you just giggled. That's so daft. What are you, twelve?”</p>
      <p>“Stoptar suas!” Caleb stood. “You're out of line.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever, Cal. You can't possibly want that.” He wanted to hurt her. Screw them both
         to
         hell.</p>
      <p>Cassie gasped.</p>
      <p>Caleb grabbed James’ arm and squeezed it hard. Tight enough to make it hurt. The people
         at the next table stopped talking.</p>
      <p>“You're making a scene,” James said. He couldn’t remember the last time they’d been
         this
         angry with one another. “You actually look like you want to puck me right now.”</p>
      <p>Caleb released him. “Follow me,” he said then headed toward the bathroom. Scooping
         his
         phone, James followed.</p>
      <p>“What the hell is the matter with you?” Caleb checked the stalls then turned. “First,
         you zone out on me, which by the way, scares the crap out of me. Then you freaking
         implode all over Cassie. I don't get it. Did I do something to you? Did she?”</p>
      <p>James slammed the door on the handicap stall. It made a satisfying crack before it
         bounced back to him. “I just want to get the hell out of here. Away from you.”</p>
      <p>“Why?” Crinkles formed around Caleb’s eyes, replacing the anger. “Talk to me.”</p>
      <p>“Because...” Damn it. He didn’t know why. “Because first you try to analyze me, and
         now
         you've sequestered me in the jacks. Cassie's waiting. Go on, run to her.”</p>
      <p>Caleb leaned on the sink, his confusion reflected in the mirror. “This is about Cassie?
         What do you want me to do? I feel horrible for last night. I want to make it up to
         her,
         but I don't want to fight with you.”</p>
      <p>James slammed the stall door again, but not with as much fervor. He sank onto his
         haunches and rested his head on his knees.</p>
      <p>“All right.” Caleb spoke into the mirror. “If it's bugging you so much, we can drop
         Cassie off and go somewhere. Just you and me.”</p>
      <p>“Great. You only want to hang with me because you're scared I’ll do something crazy.
         Stay with Cassie. I promise I won't overdose, no drinking and driving, and, oh yeah,
         I
         won't get into any fights. I have a booking tomorrow. I couldn't get wasted tonight
         if I
         wanted to.”</p>
      <p>Caleb faced him. “Where are you sleeping?”</p>
      <p>“Who knows?” James mumbled, then the full meaning of Caleb’s words hit home. “Don’t
         worry, I'll stay clear of the pool house.” He cracked his knuckles. “Use a Johnny,
         will
         ya?”</p>
      <p>Nodding, Caleb made his way to the urinals. “She may flake on me, but if she doesn’t,
         you’ll be the first to know.”</p>
      <p>“Cool.” James headed for the door. “Sorry 'bout the meltdown.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie checked her phone. What were they doing in the bathroom? Surely not discussing
         where she spent the night. James wouldn’t do that to her—or himself. She pushed her
         drink away. If someone didn't come out within five minutes, she planned to go in after
         them.</p>
      <p>James slinked out first. He walked past her like she didn't exist. A lump formed in
         her
         throat. Caleb’s eyes met hers as he ambled across the room.</p>
      <p>“Hey.” He looped his arm around her. “You okay? Did James say something else?”</p>
      <p>She snuggled into Caleb’s side. “He didn’t talk to me at all.”</p>
      <p>“He can be such a jackass sometimes. I'm sorry you have to put up with him.”</p>
      <p>She angled herself to face him. “What did you guys talk about? Did you tell him to
         be
         nice to me?”</p>
      <p>Caleb winced. “I'm sure you noticed it’s impossible to make James do anything he doesn’t
         want to. But yeah, the conversation went something like that.”</p>
      <p>“Where's he going?”</p>
      <p>“My guess. To get laid. Speaking of messing around… I'm curious what brought that
         comment on earlier. The one you whispered in my ear. You’ve been so unsure lately.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe I think it’s time.” Her gaze drifted toward the doors at the far end of the
         restaurant.</p>
      <p>“This has nothing to do with me standing you up last night, does it? I wouldn't want
         you
         to do something out of, I don't know, fear of losing me.”</p>
      <p>“Fear of losing you.” She rolled her eyes. “Should I be?”</p>
      <p>He kissed her forehead. “I'm not going anywhere.” </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
