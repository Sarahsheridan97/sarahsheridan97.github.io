      <p>After everything she’d been through with him, how could he dismiss her?</p>
      <p>She eyed the other cup of water. Part of her wanted to dump it in his lap and part
         of
         her wanted to run her hand across his forehead like she did last night. Now that he
         was
         lucid, he’d never let her near him.</p>
      <p>She stood, calling his bluff, but got no response.</p>
      <p>“Bastard.” She headed out the door, but with no intention of leaving James alone,
         ended
         up in the lounge at the end of the hall. The room was empty. Exhausted, she dropped
         onto
         the sofa.</p>
      <p>Why did Caleb have to get arrested? Asking her to stay with James was crazy. But then,
         he had no idea she harbored some sort of misguided affinity for his best friend. Why
         would he? James had been an ass to her since she met him. She didn’t even understand
         how
         she felt.</p>
      <p>Sun streamed through the window, making the room cozy. She curled her legs under her
         and
         closed her eyes.</p>
      <p>She opened them an hour later. After throwing cold water on her face in the restroom,
         she steeled herself for a blast from James.</p>
      <p>Someone opened his curtains, yet James slept soundly in the bright room. She sat on
         a
         chair and pulled out her phone. Hospital, day two, she wrote in her notes, to be
         transferred to her journal later. Summer sun can be undone… blink your eye and you
         can
         die… It needed work. She looked across to James. Asleep, he appeared okay. Normal.
         Please don’t die. She typed. I like you.</p>
      <p>Right before lunch, a nurse stopped to inform her Dr. Madison would see them shortly.
         A
         woman with a lunch cart rattled into the room a few minutes later. She placed a tray
         on
         the table and left. James made a startled noise and jolted awake.</p>
      <p>“You look a bit better,” Cassie noted when his eyes settled on her.</p>
      <p>He groaned. “You're not going to leave, are you?”</p>
      <p>She shook her head.</p>
      <p>James stared at her for a long moment, then extended his hand, tremors on display.
         “I
         need something to drink.”</p>
      <p>She passed him the Styrofoam cup from the tray. The liquid sloshed as he drank, but
         he
         finished it all then threw the empty cup toward her.</p>
      <p>“So, you're going to be shitty to me?” She picked the cup off the floor and set it
         in
         the garbage. “That's your big plan? You really want to sit here all by yourself? Do
         you
         even know what hospital you're in?”</p>
      <p>“I'm on the adolescent unit at Mount Sinai.”</p>
      <p>“Very good, James.” She mimicked his sarcastic tone. “You asked the nurse where you
         are.”</p>
      <p>“The nurse didn't have to tell me, shite, Cassie. I recognized the skyline.” He jerked
         his thumb toward the windows.</p>
      <p>Not the comeback she expected. With narrowed eyes, she scrutinized him.</p>
      <p>“I spent a lot of time on this ward when I was a kid.” He turned away. “Stop looking
         at
         me like I’m broken.”</p>
      <p>An older man wearing a brown blazer and carrying a brown leather satchel, swung into
         the
         room. He rapped the door frame as he entered.</p>
      <p>“James.” He smiled. “I wish I could say I was surprised when I received this call.”</p>
      <p>“Surprise is overrated.” James yawned. “Cassie, this is Dr. Madison, my uh, doctor.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison assessed her. Her presence threw him, she could tell.</p>
      <p>“Jaysus, relax.” James waved his hand. “She’s Cal’s girlfriend. He asked her to stay
         with me.”</p>
      <p>“I see.” Dr. Madison pulled a chair to the bed and faced James. “And are you aware
         of
         where Caleb is right now?”</p>
      <p>“I told him,” Cassie answered for James, “he didn’t see anything.”</p>
      <p>“Cassie,” James rubbed his neck, “sit down.”</p>
      <p>She plopped into the recliner.</p>
      <p>“James if you don’t mind, I’d like to get some information from Cassie.” Despite
         phrasing it as an option, it wasn’t one. Dr. Madison retrieved a bound notepad and
         pen
         from his satchel. “Tell me what you remember from last night, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>“Christ almighty.” James thumped the back of his head against the pillows as she
         launched into a rundown of the evening’s events.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for the information.” Dr. Madison said when she finished. He looked up from
         his
         notepad. “I reviewed the police report but wanted to hear it in your terms. James,
         do
         you agree with everything Cassie just relayed?”</p>
      <p>“I was bleeding to death for most of it, but yeah. If she says it went down that way,
         it
         went down that way.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison scribbled something else. “I hear you tore things up in the emergency
         room
         last night.”</p>
      <p>“Really?” Cassie leaned forward.</p>
      <p>“Turn your eyes off, angel,” James said, then, after a second added, “relax. I'm
         fine.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison flipped to a new page. His brows knit together as his pen scraped the
         paper.</p>
      <p>Groaning, James worked the edge of his blanket. “Stop feckin writing. This is bloody
         bullshit.”</p>
      <p>A few seconds passed before Dr. Madison placed his notes inside his case. He sat back
         and folded his arms. “According to the incident report, you punched one of the ambulance
         personnel as soon as they undid the restraints. Then, in recovery, you tried to get
         off
         the bed, knocking equipment over, and sent a nurse into a wall. Do you have any
         recollection of this?”</p>
      <p>“No.” James’ cheeks pinkened. “And I don't need to be told what an ass I was.”</p>
      <p>Cassie shifted uneasily “He wouldn’t have been so angry if they hadn’t strapped him
         down.”</p>
      <p>The doctor’s head jerked to her, then to James. “I am truly sorry about that. I gave
         the
         doctor who called me a piece of my mind, but it wasn't his fault and you're lucky
         he
         called. After your behavior, they had every reason to keep you restrained.”</p>
      <p>“How did you get called?” James eyed her. “All my stuff says Fitzpatrick.”</p>
      <p>“I was searching through your wallet for an ID.” She dug his wallet out of her purse
         and
         handed it to him. “Caleb gave it to me before the ambulance got there,” she said in
         response to his puzzled expression. “I have your phone too.”</p>
      <p>He skimmed through the compartments. If he noticed his school ID was missing, he didn't
         say anything.</p>
      <p>“Keep it for now.” He tossed her the wallet then eyed his doctor. “Now. Where the
         hell
         is Cal?”</p>
      <p>The man planted his hand on James’ shoulder. “The police are holding him.”</p>
      <p>The news brought Cassie to her feet. She half expected that but hadn’t planned on
         dropping it on James anytime soon. She stepped toward the bed.</p>
      <p>“Holding him?” James struggled to free himself from his doctor’s grip. Panting, he
         sank
         onto the mattress. “This feckin sucks. Cal was protecting me.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison sighed. “Caleb was drunk in a public place and interfered with an
         investigation. As a minor, he needs to be released into the custody of a parent.”</p>
      <p>“Where’s Elizabeth?”</p>
      <p>“She’s gone 'till Sunday, James,” Cassie said, “the weekend getaway. You were there
         when
         Caleb told me.” She seriously wondered about James’ memory.</p>
      <p>“Sunday.” He scowled. “Cal could be getting the shit kicked out of him right about
         now.
         Because of me.”</p>
      <p>Without thinking, Cassie placed her hand over his. He didn’t shake her off.</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison cleared his throat. “I spoke with the arresting officer and explained
         the
         dynamic to him. Caleb will be released to his mother, and have to pay a fine. She’s
         on
         her way back.” He leaned forward. “Caleb isn’t my concern. I have more pressing matters
         to discuss with you.”</p>
      <p>“Let me guess.” Bitterness dripped from James’ voice. “They ran a toxicology report.</p>
      <p>Dr. Madison nodded. “Cassie, can we have a moment?” His gaze rested on their linked
         hands, his eyes sad.</p>
      <p>James pulled his hand away.</p>
      <p>She crossed the room to the windows. If they wanted more privacy, one of them would
         have
         to ask her to leave. Catching every fifth word, she surveyed the outside. Life on
         the
         ground seemed far away. Behind her, James swore, and their voices grew softer.</p>
      <p>“Cassie.” Dr. Madison addressed her from the open doorway. “Can I speak with you
         privately?”</p>
      <p>“Leave her alone,” James said, “she’s got nothing to do with this.”</p>
      <p>Cassie waited, halfway to the door, for James to say something else.</p>
      <p>“Jaysus.” He motioned for her to follow. “Go on.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“He seems a bit protective of you.” Dr. Madison said as she stepped into the hallway.
         “Can I offer you some advice?”</p>
      <p>“Okay.” she said, though she would rather not hear it. It was easy to tell he didn’t
         approve of her being there.</p>
      <p>“James has a lot on his plate and isn’t handling things in an appropriate manner.”
         Doctor Madison smiled, but his words were firm. “I suggest you give him some space.”</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
