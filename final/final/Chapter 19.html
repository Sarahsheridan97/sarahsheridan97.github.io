         <h4>Chapter 19</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Cassie waited in the doorway as the unit aid settled James into his room.</p>
      <p>“I wish everyone would disappear and leave us alone,” James said as the aid finished.
         When the door shut, he pulled a cigarette pack from under his gown.</p>
      <p>“Where did you get those?” She grinned, more baffled than angry. “You can’t smoke
         in
         here.”</p>
      <p>“Are they gonna toss me out?” He pulled matches from the pack, then blew smoke at
         her.
         “Do I amuse you? You remind me of Cal. Always laughing at me.”</p>
      <p>“And what would Caleb say about you smoking in here?”</p>
      <p>“Cal would check to make sure the oxygen port was closed, then say, ‘give me a drag’.
         He
         motioned toward the door. “There’s a ton of games in the lounge. Why don't you go
         pick
         something out for us?”</p>
      <p>If he managed to smuggle cigarettes, what else could he produce from under his gown?
         Not
         that she was foolish enough to ask such a loaded question. “It's late.” She eyed his
         smock. “You really want to play a game?”</p>
      <p>“Holy shit, angel. Chill. I don't have heroin stashed under my blanket. Lift it up
         and
         check me out if you don't believe me.” One side of his mouth twisted into a grin.
         “You’re as bad as your boyfriend. I'm not trying to kill myself.”</p>
      <p>“Could have fooled me.”</p>
      <p>He popped the lid off the Styrofoam cups and dropped his cigarette into his water.
         “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
      <p>“You don’t seem to like yourself very much.” She didn’t want to get into an emotionally
         laden conversation this late in the evening. Not when his face told her he was in
         more
         pain than he let on.</p>
      <p>James rubbed his chin. “What makes you say that?”</p>
      <p>“You have no respect for your body.”</p>
      <p>“Did that come from Caleb?”</p>
      <p>“No. But I know he hates watching you destroy yourself. He’s so worried about you,
         he
         has a hard time living his own life.” She stopped. That broached saying too much.</p>
      <p>“Nonsense.” James shook his head. “Cal worries too much. I can take care of myself.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I can see that.” Cassie motioned to their surroundings. “You need to lighten
         up
         on Caleb. He cares about what happens to you.”</p>
      <p>Emotion swirled behind James’ features. “Look at you,” he finally got out, his voice
         thick, “all protective of my best friend.”</p>
      <p>“Never mind.” She looked at the ceiling. “I'll go find a game.” </p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As James predicted, a plethora of board games waited in the lobby. In a rush to get
         back, she grabbed cards and a crib board off the top shelf, her grandma’s favorite
         game.</p>
      <p>“Hope you know how to play cribbage,” she said as she entered the room. She stopped
         short. James extended his hand toward her, fingers clenched in a tight fist.</p>
      <p>“Take these.” He uncurled his fingers. Two pills lay cradled against his palm. “Now,”
         he
         said louder when she failed to move. “Flush them.”</p>
      <p>She dropped the crib board and cards onto the table and plucked up the pills. “What
         are
         they?”</p>
      <p>“Something I’m not swallowing.” He retreated against his pillow and closed his eyes.
         “Get rid of them before I change my mind.”</p>
      <p>“They’re gone,” she said when she returned to the room. She sat in the chair and folded
         her hands in her lap. “Why didn’t you take them?”</p>
      <p>“Because I’m not delusional enough to think you wouldn’t notice.” He gave her a rueful
         grin. “Don't tell Caleb.”</p>
      <p>“About the pills? Or your toxicology report?” Or something totally different?</p>
      <p>“He'll find out about the report sooner than later.” James ran his hand through his
         hair, leaving it a mess of swoops and angles. “Don’t tell him about the pills, about
         the
         catheter…” his voice trailed off. “Or about me wanting you to stay.” He studied her.
         “This is Vegas. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?”</p>
      <p>She nodded. He looked so tired—she would sell her soul if it would make him feel
         better.</p>
      <p>“Swing the table over the bed.” He blew out a puff of air and squirmed into a sitting
         position. “Are we gonna play cribbage or what? I’m sure I’ve played every game
         here.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Crib proved to be beyond James' capabilities, and more stressful than Cassie imagined.
         His shaking hands made it impossible for him to manipulate the pegs. Even holding
         his
         cards required too much dexterity. He rested his arms on his thighs, cards so low
         Cassie
         could read them.</p>
      <p>Except for two bright dots of color on either cheek, his pallor took on a grayish
         tinge.
         Sweat plastered his hospital gown to his chest. He plucked at the material, pulling
         it
         away from his skin. She bet his pain level neared ten on that pain management scale.</p>
      <p>“Do you want me to get a nurse?” she asked when she could no longer stand to watch
         him
         suffer.</p>
      <p>“Don’t bother. They won’t give me what I want.” He laid his cards down. “Move me eight
         points.”</p>
      <p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
      <p>He nodded slightly and tossed his crib cards on top of the others. “Six points in
         my
         cribbage. That’s fourteen points total. Come on, Cassie, advance my peg.”</p>
      <p>She moved his peg, then reached around him for the buzzer. “I’m getting a nurse.”</p>
      <p>A woman appeared almost instantaneously, tendrils of black hair falling out of a messy
         bun. She carried a tray that held another Styrofoam cup and a small container.</p>
      <p>Cassie got up. “He needs something for pain.”</p>
      <p>“I was on my way here.” The woman checked James’ wristband before setting the tray
         on
         the table. “I’ve brought tramadol.”</p>
      <p>James stared into the container holding the pill. “You’re giving me one Tramadol?
         I got
         feckin stabbed.” He scowled at the girl. “I want Dilaudid. In my feckin arm.”</p>
      <p>The woman wilted. “I can only deliver what they give me.”</p>
      <p>He stared at her tag. “Jaysus, an LPN. You're useless. Tell the nurse practitioner
         to
         write me a new prescription. And don’t tell me there’s no NP on the floor.” He waved
         her
         off.</p>
      <p>She stayed where she was, mouth open.</p>
      <p>“Do you have a problem understanding English?”</p>
      <p>“James!” Cassie covered her mouth. “It’s not her fault.”</p>
      <p>“It is her fault. She wasn’t bright enough to go to med school.” He glared at the
         girl
         as she retreated from the room, then directed his glower at Cassie. “Deal.”</p>
      <p>With a deep breath, Cassie counted her points then shuffled the cards. “You need to
         take
         the medication they give you.”</p>
      <p>“What do you know about meds?” he scoffed. “Or pain?” He reached for the water. The
         bottom of the cup caught the edge of the table. The lid dislodged and water spilled
         into
         his lap, soaking his blanket.</p>
      <p>“Bloody hell.” He shoved the blanket against the table. The crib pegs teetered. Three
         of
         them fell over and rolled onto the floor. “Fuck!”</p>
      <p>Cassie scanned the door, expecting someone to burst through.</p>
      <p>“I can't stand this. I'm completely effing useless.” He threw the wooden crib board
         across the room. It whizzed past her head and smacked the wall.</p>
      <p>After a second, she stepped forward. “I'll get a nurse to change the bedding.” She
         pulled the wet blanket off his legs. “You’re soaked.”</p>
      <p>He swung his legs over the bed, his features pinched. “Bring the sheets yourself.
         I
         don't want to see anyone.”</p>
      <p>Despite his outburst, she wasn’t scared. He was mad at himself, not her. The nursing
         station was busy, so she walked the hall in search of bedding. A door labeled clean
         supply had been left open.</p>
      <p>“I thought you’d left,” James said when she returned with a stack of linens.</p>
      <p>He had abandoned his bed for the chair. His pillow lay across his lap, his gown a
         heap
         on the floor. He resembled a little child in a timeout.</p>
      <p>The thought made her smile. “Are you naked?”</p>
      <p>“Do bandages count as clothing? My gown’s wet. You said so yourself.” Tight-lipped,
         he
         stared toward the window.</p>
      <p>“You’re shivering.” Cassie inched closer, then stopped. He was naked. What did she
         intend to do? Hug him?</p>
      <p>He raised his hand. “Spare me the pity. I'm not a complete moron. I realize I brought
         this on myself.”</p>
      <p>“Here.” She handed him the gown off the top of the linens. “I found pajama bottoms
         too.”
         She held them up. They were triple his size.</p>
      <p>James scrutinized them, nose wrinkled. “Gee, thanks, Cassie. You brought me clown
         pants.” He tactically shifted the pillow and stood. But instead of grabbing the pajamas,
         his fingers encircled her wrist. His eyes locked on hers. “Really. Thanks.”</p>
      <p>“You’re welcome.” Her gaze slipped, over the pillow, to his bare feet.</p>
      <p>His fingers lingered then he slid his hand down, to relieve her of the pants. He pulled
         them easily from her grip.</p>
      <p>She dropped the linens on the bed and unfolded the fitted sheet. James slipped into
         the
         bottoms, behind her, then slinked into the bathroom. He returned as she straightened
         the
         creases from the final blanket.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t have bothered with the top,” he said, standing beside her, “but I've been
         feeling kinda naked lately. I guess hospital green is better than jumpsuit orange.”</p>
      <p>Cassie lifted the corner of the blanket and waited for him to climb in.</p>
      <p>His forehead wrinkled. “Orange. Get it? The ones you wear in jail.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, hospital humor. Ha.” She tucked him in. “I get it.”</p>
      <p>He ran his hand over the blanket. “Not a bad job.”</p>
      <p>“I know how to make a bed, James.” She glanced at him. His eyes were greener than
         usual,
         the color of Kansas grass. There wasn’t enough grass in Chicago. “You seem less
         angry.”</p>
      <p>He grunted. “I just pissed on my own. That made me happy.”</p>
      <p>For some reason his blunt honesty made her laugh. “What do you want to do?”</p>
      <p>“I want you to look at me.”</p>
      <p>She swung her gaze back to his, subjecting herself to his cocked head examination.
         Unable to maintain eye contact, she turned away again.</p>
      <p>Chuckling, he adjusted his pillow. “Tell me a story. Something about you. Who are
         you,
         angel? How did you land in my doorway?”</p>
      <p>“Uh.” Did he really want a story? She plopped into the big armchair across the room.</p>
      <p>“Come over here. I want you closer.”</p>
      <p>Closer wasn’t cool, but she pulled the chair to the bed and sat down. She covered
         herself with the extra blanket, tucking it under her chin. “I hate hospitals.”</p>
      <p>“You’ve been in one?”</p>
      <p>“I have.” He wasn’t the only one that experienced pain. She shifted in the chair.
         “I had
         this best friend… Paul. We grew up together.”</p>
      <p>“Had.” The muscle in his jaw popped, evidence he guessed the trajectory of her
         story.</p>
      <p>“When I turned sixteen, we decided to date. I’m not sure why. It wasn’t like I liked
         him
         that way. I think I just didn’t want to see him with somebody else, because then he’d
         have no time for me.” It sounded lame.</p>
      <p>“You felt like you were losing him.”</p>
      <p>“That is exactly how I felt. How did you know that?”</p>
      <p>He shrugged. “Years of therapy.”</p>
      <p>“Anyway,” she continued, “I knew right away the relationship was a mistake. Making
         out
         was awkward and embarrassing. Paul wanted more, I didn’t. It sounds dumb, but I kept
         thinking, ‘he’s not the one.’” She cleared her throat. “I wanted to go back to being
         friends, but everyone thought we were this perfect couple, so I let it go on. Longer
         than it should have.”</p>
      <p>James narrowed his eyes. “What happened?”</p>
      <p>There was a change in his tone. One she wouldn’t have noticed before this weekend,
         but
         now recognized. He didn’t like what he was hearing.</p>
      <p>“One night, Paul got mad when I refused to do what he wanted. I told him I wanted
         to
         leave, to break up with him. He ripped my shirt off and I slapped him. He hit me back.
         Hard.”</p>
      <p>“Did he…?” James stalled, his expression blank, one hand tangled in the sheets; her
         tight corner pulled untucked.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t rape me,” she said, “he snapped out of it—realized what he’d done—and begged
         me not to tell anyone. I walked home in shock. I didn't even put my shoes on. It was
         December.”</p>
      <p>“Does Cal know any of this?”</p>
      <p>She shook her head. “I should have slept with Paul. Maybe I would have grown to want
         him
         like that.”</p>
      <p>James relinquished his hold on the bedding and cracked his knuckles. “It doesn’t work
         that way. You either feel something for someone or you don’t. What happened when you
         got
         home?”</p>
      <p>“No one was there, so I showered and got dressed. I tried to pretend everything was
         the
         same, but I couldn’t stop crying. When my mom got home, she took one look at my face
         and
         freaked out. I ended up in the hospital emergency with a hairline fracture to my orbital
         bone.</p>
      <p>“They wanted to keep me for observation, but I begged to go home. My parents got into
         this huge fight over my dad always giving in to me, and I ended up going home with
         him.
         My mom disappeared for a week. Her standard M.O. when things don't go her way.”</p>
      <p>“Your mom sounds like a piece of work.” James huffed. “What about the jackass?”</p>
      <p>“My dad knew we broke up, but I lied about what happened. I told him I got hit with
         a
         ball in gym, but Paul assumed I told everyone what he did.” She blinked. This part
         hurt
         the most. “By the time I got back to school, he had told everyone I cheated on him,
         got
         pregnant, and had an abortion. And everyone believed him. I lived in the bible belt.
         Most of my friends were strict Baptists. Nobody had abortions.”</p>
      <p>James rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I bet.”</p>
      <p>“When I went back to school, Paul harassed me—notes on my locker, texts, that type
         of
         thing. I promised him I didn't tell anyone and begged him to make up, but the more
         I
         persisted the crueler he became.” She shuddered. “I failed the first semester, then
         dropped out.”</p>
      <p>“Is that why you moved?”</p>
      <p>“Sort of. My dad got this offer and figured it would be good for me. My mom, not so
         much. But my mom was never there for me. She dumped me on a nanny as soon as I was
         born.
         I’m sure she got pregnant to trap my dad. She never wanted me.”</p>
      <p>Her chest tightened. She never admitted that to anyone. “I don’t know what’s wrong
         with
         me. Why I even tried to be friends with Paul again.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe you think you deserve the abuse.” He laid his head against the pillow, eyes
         forward. “Why are you telling me this?”</p>
      <p>She took a breath and decided to be truthful. “Because sometimes you seem as alone
         as I
         feel.”</p>
      <p>“You’re wrong, Cassie.” He reclined his bed, the quiet hum of the motor the only noise.
         “I’m not lonely.”</p>
      <p>She sunk farther into the chair. What had she expected? For him to cry and admit she
         was
         right?</p>
      <p>“Hey,” he said, his voice softer. He reached for her hand. “You should tell Cal.”</p>
      <p>“Are you going to tell him?”</p>
      <p>“Hell no. That’s your call.” He squeezed her hand, his eyes blank, like he expended
         the
         last of his energy comforting her. He stared toward the ceiling, lost to her, until
         his
         eyes closed, and his grip relaxed.</p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
