         <h4>Chapter 20</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Sleep was impossible. James mumbled nonstop and thrashed back and forth so violently,
         Cassie extended the bed rails. Minutes slow ticked into hours. At the first sign of
         pink
         on the horizon, she went in search of his help.</p>
      <p>Still early, the nursing station seemed sleepy. Cassie sized up the lone woman staring
         groggily into the computer monitor. “I think my friend needs pain medication. Room
         601.”</p>
      <p>“You must be Cassie.” The woman examined her from behind the counter. She didn’t smile.
         “We don't want him in pain any more than you do, but if he refuses the prescribed
         medication, there is nothing we can do.”</p>
      <p>“When my grandpa was in the hospital,” Cassie countered, “he had pain relief at the
         push
         of a button.”</p>
      <p>The nurse lumbered into a standing position. “I'm guessing Grandpa didn't have the
         toxicology report or the history we have on your boyfriend.”</p>
      <p>“James may have had drugs in his system, but he’s not some homeless addict.” Why did
         everyone expect the worst from him?</p>
      <p>“Maybe not.” The nurse removed her glasses and met Cassie’s gaze. “But he is on an
         individual pain management program. One that does not involve being able to
         self-medicate. If he wants to feel better, you need to get him to swallow the pills
         we
         are giving him. And, while you are at it, get him to stop swearing at hospital
         personnel.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The sound of running water greeted Cassie when she returned to James’ room. Groaning,
         she approached the half-open bathroom door. “James, what are you doing in there?”</p>
      <p>“Taking a shower. Feel free to join me.”</p>
      <p>She peeked through the doorway. Sure enough, steam billowed over the top of the shower
         curtain.</p>
      <p>“Are you supposed to get those stitches wet?” Damn, didn't he think? Ever?</p>
      <p>“Don't care. I was manky.”</p>
      <p>Sighing, she headed back to the nursing station and approached the same woman. “Can
         he
         shower?”</p>
      <p>The nurse typed something into the computer. “It’s been over thirty hours. A gentle
         shower won’t hurt. Did someone go over proper wound care with him?”</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure.” It wasn’t like he would listen.</p>
      <p>The nurse grunted. “Tell Mr. Fitzpatrick I’m coming to see him and to leave the area
         uncovered.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The water was off when Cassie returned. James emerged a few seconds later. The tip
         of
         his unbandaged stitches, angry against his skin, peaked out above a low wrapped
         towel.</p>
      <p>“Where’s that bag of clothes?” he asked, “The clown pants were a blast, but it’s time
         for something a little more enticing.”</p>
      <p>“Enticing?” The titter in her voice infuriated her. She grabbed the bag off the table
         and tossed it at him.</p>
      <p>James flinched as the bag hit his shoulder. It landed at his feet. With a grimace,
         he
         carefully stooped to retrieve it. After digging out his underwear retreated into the
         bathroom. A minute later, he stood before her, briefs on, the towel around his neck.</p>
      <p>Lounging against the bathroom’s door frame, he resembled an advertisement for male
         undergarments.</p>
      <p>“What?” His smile was coy. “It's not like you haven't seen me in these before. In
         fact,
         I think I wore these exact ones the night you materialized in the pool house.”</p>
      <p>The smell of antiseptic soap lingered in the stale hospital air as he brushed past.
         He
         propped himself against the side of the bed and pulled the waistband of his underwear
         away from his stomach. He peered downward. “Jaysus. These stitches are nasty.”</p>
      <p>Her heart fluttered. He was being far too flirty and was way too naked. She helped
         him
         into the high bed and drew the covers up, minding her eyes, careful not to feed into
         his
         game.</p>
      <p>“Another nurse is coming to see you.” The words rushed out of her.</p>
      <p>“Is she hot?”</p>
      <p>Cassie shook her head. The nurse looked like she should have retired—twenty years
         ago.
         She couldn’t wait to see his reaction.</p>
      <p>James groaned. “If I'm going to keep getting molested by hospital staff, they could
         at
         least be good looking.”</p>
      <p>“Wouldn’t it be easier if they weren’t?”</p>
      <p>He cocked an eyebrow. “And why is that?”</p>
      <p>“You know.” Did she have to spell it out? “The location of your stitches. People
         prodding around—down there.” This whole experience would be so much easier if he got
         stabbed in the shoulder.</p>
      <p>James laughed. His real laugh. “I'm a big boy. I have everything under control.” He
         batted his lashes. “How ‘bout you? Want to check out my injury? See what my response
         is?
         Test my control?”</p>
      <p>Everything was a joke to him. Refusing to be his punch line, she crossed her arms.
         “I’ve
         seen enough.”</p>
      <p>Both his eyebrows shot up. “Saw enough? How much was that?”</p>
      <p>Between bandages and common courtesy, she hadn't seen much, but her skin flushed just
         the same. “There’s no point in embarrassing you.”</p>
      <p>“I'm not embarrassed,” he said, although his pink cheeks suggested otherwise.</p>
      <p>A girl not much older than them pushed a cart into the room. Her tight, hot pink scrubs
         suggested they were altered. James flipped Cassie a surprised look, then smiled his
         approval. “Dia duit álainn.”</p>
      <p>The girl parked her cart alongside James’ bed, then tucked a strand of long blonde
         hair
         behind her ear. “I’m not sure what that means but I’m Linda. And you are Mr.
         Fitzpatrick, correct?”</p>
      <p>Nodding, he lifted his arm so she could check his hospital bracelet. “I said, hello,
         beautiful.”</p>
      <p>Cassie stared at the girl. Linda was a huge improvement over the much older, and way
         heavier nurse, but beautiful? Her name tag dangled off a lanyard, the letters CNA
         in
         full view. Cassie braced for James’ flip out, but he allowed Linda to check his
         bracelet.</p>
      <p>“Let’s take your blood pressure.” Linda picked up a cuff from the cart. “Hold out
         your
         arm for me. I love your ink, by the way.”</p>
      <p>“Where is the nurse on duty?” Cassie interrupted.</p>
      <p>Linda remained quiet until she removed the cuff. “Nurse Toleman was busy. I volunteered
         to help.”</p>
      <p>“Lucky me,” James said, hands laced behind his head.</p>
      <p>“Aww. You’re too cute.” Linda shooed Cassie away from the bed. “Do you mind giving
         us
         some privacy?” She drew the curtain without waiting for a reply.</p>
      <p>Cassie stomped to the window and pressed her forehead against the cool glass. Leave
         it
         to James to find someone to flirt with in a hospital.</p>
      <p>“What happened to your gown?” Linda’s voice floated from behind the curtain. “Let's
         move
         these down a bit so I can get a look at those stitches.”</p>
      <p>“You're really great at this, Linda,” James said, his voice smooth. “I bet you’re
         good
         at a lot of things.”</p>
      <p>Something twisted in Cassie’s stomach. She inched toward the curtain.</p>
      <p>“Shh.” Linda chuckled. “Tell me if this hurts?”</p>
      <p>“Not much,” James said, “do you like what you see?”</p>
      <p>Cassie swung the curtain open. “Are you done yet?” Linda’s hand rested on James’
         stomach. They both turned to stare at her. Cassie jerked the curtain shut, then rushed
         out the door.</p>
      <p>In the cafeteria, she called Caleb again, craving the security he gave her. Still
         no
         answer. Come on. It was Sunday, his parents must be home by now. Armed with a machine
         latte, she laid her cheek on the cool table and studied the side of her cup. What
         was
         her problem? James was not her boyfriend and she made a complete fool of herself.
         If she
         planned to go back to the room, she would need to be more composed—and less insane.</p>
      <p>An hour later, Cassie eased open the door to James’ room. He glanced up, then went
         back
         his magazine. “Linda brought me something to read,” he said. “Isn't she super?”</p>
      <p>A selection of books lay beside the tray of his half-eaten breakfast. “I’m glad she
         took
         care of you,” Cassie said.</p>
      <p>He inspected her with wide eyes, his brow wrinkled. Not that she could blame his baffled
         expression. She considered apologizing for her outburst, but could only mumble, “I
         should go home.” With a bowed head, she turned to open the door.</p>
      <p>“Wait.” Surprising her with how quickly he moved, he pulled up behind her. “You’re
         always running from me.”</p>
      <p>“I am not.”</p>
      <p>James stretched his arm over her shoulder and pressed his palm against the closed
         door.
         “What is going on with you?”</p>
      <p>“Nothing,” she said, “nothings going on with me.”</p>
      <p>“Seriously, Cassie. Turn around. I want you to look at me.”</p>
      <p>Sighing, she faced him. A tiny bit of roughness decorated his chin. His hip bones
         grazed
         hers.</p>
      <p>“You seemed almost jealous of that nurse.”</p>
      <p>“That’s ludicrous.” There wasn’t enough space between them, but there was too much
         space. “I just think CNA's should do other, less important things,” she said with
         closed
         eyes, “like cleaning bedpans or mopping up puke.”</p>
      <p>“If you ask me, she should have been the one to remove my catheter.”</p>
      <p>Cassie opened her eyes and glared at him. Little flecks of hazel twinkled in the green
         of his irises.</p>
      <p>“I'm joking. It's just…” He adjusted his feet, his leg between hers. “I got the
         impression you didn't like her hands on me.” He lowered his head.</p>
      <p>She needed to shove him, slap him, call his bluff. She held her breath.</p>
      <p>Wincing, he withdrew his arm and stepped back, unsteady. “Damnit.” He pressed his
         hand
         against his wound.</p>
      <p>For once fate sided with her. She unglued herself from the door and took hold of James’
         elbow. “Let's get you back to bed,” she said in Linda's sing-song voice.</p>
      <p>James chuckled. “Linda was pretty.” He searched her face. “Her hands were warm.”</p>
      <p>Linda’s warm hands were none of her business. Keeping her expression neutral, Cassie
         spread the blanket over him.</p>
      <p>James retrieved a piece of paper from the side table. “She gave me her number.”</p>
      <p>“Doesn’t that break some sort of nursing code?”</p>
      <p>“I think it’s cool.” Blinking innocently, he shoved the paper at her. “It's not like
         I
         have a girlfriend, and I have a thing for blondes.”</p>
      <p>Cassie unfolded the paper. Linda penned her digits in red, complete with a heart over
         the i.</p>
      <p>“Have you slept with Cal yet?”</p>
      <p>“Huh?” James’ question came from nowhere. She tossed the number onto the bed. “You
         didn't just ask me that.”</p>
      <p>He grinned. “You’ll have to put out eventually.”</p>
      <p>“Really.” She hated that he knew she was a virgin. “What else does Caleb say about
         me?”</p>
      <p>James crinkled the paper and tossed it onto the table. “Cal refuses to talk about
         you.”</p>
      <p>“You’ve questioned him?”</p>
      <p>He grinned wider. “I'm feeling better. Watch this.” He held his hand out. It didn’t
         shake as much. “You'll be pleased to know I took your advice.”</p>
      <p>“How so?” She set the crib board up for another game.</p>
      <p>“I was polite and took my medication. You’d have been proud, but you were off skulking
         and missed it.”</p>
      <p>“I wasn't skulking. I wanted to give you and Linda some alone time.”</p>
      <p>Taking her place in her chair, she counted six cards apiece. “Are you ever going to
         tell
         me what you took on Friday?”</p>
      <p>“Probably not. But it’s not as bad as everyone assumes.”</p>
      <p>Cassie looked up from her cards.</p>
      <p>“Come on, Cassie. I realize what everyone thinks. That I'm some crazy needle user.”</p>
      <p>Without meaning to, she flicked her gaze to his arms.</p>
      <p>“Don't search too hard,” he said. “Cal’s always checking for needle marks, but I
         wouldn't take a hit in my arm. Think about it. You can push a needle in anywhere.”</p>
      <p>The thought of James sticking needles into his body nauseated her.</p>
      <p>“Relax. I won’t be doing anything for a bit.” He ran his fingers through his hair.
         “All
         this bullshit bought me time in rehab.”</p>
      <p>“When did you find this out?” She barely left his side.</p>
      <p>“Dr. Madison told me yesterday.” He touched her cheek. You didn’t think I was this
         fecked up, did you? You should run.”</p>
      <p>“W-When?” she stammered, lost in the tractor beam of his gaze and the warmth of his
         gesture.</p>
      <p>“I would run now.”</p>
      <p>“No. When do you go?”</p>
      <p>“When I get out of here. Tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>The door opened. James’ hand dropped from her face. Cassie turned, expecting to see
         CNA
         Linda, but Caleb stood in the doorway. A purple bruise on his cheek blended into the
         dark circles under his eyes.</p>
      <p>She wanted Caleb this entire weekend, but now that he was here, the timing seemed
         wrong.
         She backed away from the bed, putting as much space between her and James as the room
         allowed.</p>
      <p>“Holy fuck.” Caleb crossed the floor in a few determined strides. He hadn’t noticed
         James’ hand on her cheek. It was like he didn’t notice her at all.</p>
      <p>He slumped forward, palms on the mattress. “No one would tell me how you were all
         weekend.”</p>
      <p>“You look worse than me.” James stated the obvious, knots forming in his forehead.
         “How
         was Juvie?”</p>
      <p>“Here.” Caleb pulled a ring from his pocket. “This was the only thing the front desk
         had
         of yours.” He waited until James slid it on, before continuing. “My weekend sucked.
         But
         you hear a lot in there. Like the dude that stabbed you sold Percocet.”</p>
      <p>The creases in James’ brow deepened. He nodded to where she stood against the
         windows.</p>
      <p>“Cassie.” Caleb spread his arms wide, his knuckles red scabby. “Get over here.”</p>
      <p>She snuggled against him, enjoying the solid shape of his body and the safety of his
         arms.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for babysitting,” he whispered, before issuing a soft kiss on her lips.</p>
      <p>“Where’s Mom?” James said, loudly. “You can’t be here by yourself. Getting stabbed
         must
         merit the attention of at least one parent.”</p>
      <p>“She stopped by the bathroom.” Caleb draped his arm over Cassie’s shoulder. “Why don’t
         you go home and get some rest? We can take it from here.”</p>
      <p>James turned his icy glare to her. “Yeah, Cassie. Thanks for babysitting.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t be a jerk.” Caleb squeezed her shoulders. “I’m sure she had better things to
         do
         than hang here, letting you snarl at her.” He pulled two twenties from his wallet.
         “Can
         you grab a taxi?”</p>
      <p>“Go on.” James waved. “Bugger off.”</p>
      <p>What an ass. She thought something magical happened between them, that they at least
         became friends. But he used her because she was all he had at the time. She gave Caleb
         a
         passionate kiss. “I’ll come by the pool house tonight,” she said, as she withdrew
         from
         his embrace. “I’ll make you feel better.”</p>
      <p>The words tumbled out. She didn’t want to see Caleb. She wanted space, time to process
         the weekend. But it was too late. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
