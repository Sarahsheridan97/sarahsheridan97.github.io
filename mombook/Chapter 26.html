         <h4>Chapter 26</h4>
      </div>
      <p>James skidded to a halt at the base of the pier and headed back to the house. Now
         would
         be the time to wipe his hands clean of this whole mess. Why should he care what happened
         to Cassie?</p>
      <p>But he did care. He turned back to the water.</p>
      <p>Shit, he was spinning in circles. He’d been less confused drunk off his ass than he
         was
         right now stone-cold sober.</p>
      <p>“James, is that you?” Cassie scrambled to her feet. She swayed, close to the edge
         of the
         dock.</p>
      <p>In anticipation of a rescue dive, James discarded his hoodie and closed the distance.
         He
         plopped at her feet and patted the wooden planks. “Come on, Cassie, sit for a
         spell.”</p>
      <p>She maneuvered into a sitting position and wiped her eyes. “Do you have any idea where
         Caleb is?”</p>
      <p>“Haven't heard from him all night.” He allowed her to search his face until it became
         unbearable, then shifted his gaze across the water.</p>
      <p>“Liar,” she accused, “you always know where he is.”</p>
      <p>“Not anymore.” Lately, he hardly recognized the guy at all. “I lost track of him when
         you moved next door.”</p>
      <p>They sat silent for a moment then she nudged his shoulder. “Sorry my moving here hurt
         you somehow.”</p>
      <p>Hurt wasn’t the right word. He’d been angry with her at first, but now she exhausted
         him. He laid back, the planks cool under his shirt, and brought his arm over his face.
         The last thing he needed was a girl on his mind twenty-four seven, especially this
         one.
         Too much shit filled his head already.</p>
      <p>Something soft tickled his elbow. He peeked out. Cassie peered down at him, the ends
         of
         her hair—golden fleece—brushed his skin.</p>
      <p>“All summer, I’ve been low key begging Caleb to sleep with me.” She hiccupped. “He
         kept
         refusing. Did he tell you that?”</p>
      <p>James propped himself up on his elbows. “Cal keeps mum on you.”</p>
      <p>“He turned me down flat—until last week. Then. This is the best part. When he wanted
         to
         have sex, I couldn’t.”</p>
      <p>He sat up. “Why not?”</p>
      <p>“It didn't feel right.”</p>
      <p>Nothing was right about any of this, especially the coy smile accompanying her
         words.</p>
      <p>Scared to pursue another why, he inhaled a deep breath then exhaled slow. “You shouldn’t
         be telling me this. You're not thinking clear right now. You’re fluthered.”</p>
      <p>Her nose crinkled. “English, please.”</p>
      <p>As a child, he’d witnessed dead drunk, puking drunk, angry drunk, and people pissing
         themselves drunk, but fluthered was the worst. It was the type of drunk where his
         stepdad would sit him on his lap and cry. He would pat him on the head and say in
         a
         broken voice, “I love you, James. I’m extra hard on you so you’ll be better.”</p>
      <p>He glanced to the left where, ten houses down his pier stretched into the night.
         “Fluthered means sloppy drunk.”</p>
      <p>“Are you…fluthered.” She inched closer.</p>
      <p>“You think I'm drunk?”</p>
      <p>She frowned. “You’re at a party full of girls, but here you are, talking to me. You
         must
         be drunk because you hate me, right?”</p>
      <p>The conversation became dangerous. He stretched his legs over the edge of the dock,
         the
         souls of his converse skimming the water. “Hate’s a strong word, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>“I saw you watching me.”</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t.”</p>
      <p>“James,” she hiccupped again, “I’m drunk, not blind.”</p>
      <p>Now would be a good time to bring her back to the party—and vanish, but she leaned
         into
         his side, and walking away seemed impossible.</p>
      <p>“I need to confess,” she said after a few minutes, “I saw you skinny dipping in Caleb’s
         pool.”</p>
      <p>He hmphed. “Did you like what you saw?”</p>
      <p>“I thought you were hot. But I didn’t see the real you then.”</p>
      <p>“If you’ve discovered the real me, you need to get in touch with my shrink. He’s been
         searching forever.”</p>
      <p>She rested her head against his shoulder. “Funny. I found him right away.”</p>
      <p>He loathed fluthered drunks. Half the bullshit they said was spoken on a truthful
         tongue.</p>
      <p>“Do you like me?” she asked, her voice a whisper on the water.</p>
      <p>Like he had the liberty to admit, even to himself, that he might like her. “Cal has
         picked worse chicks,” he said.</p>
      <p>She scoffed, unhappy with his answer and oblivious to the conflict she caused. “So…
         you
         think I’m pretty?”</p>
      <p>If he only thought she was hot, he’d understand his damn emotions. He got that he
         wanted
         her on a physical level, but she was in his head, crashing around, plugged into all
         his
         circuits—and overloading them.</p>
      <p>“Stop asking me shite I can’t answer.” He squeezed her shoulder to take the sting
         from
         his words. “I feel like my feet are trapped in quicksand most of the time; God only
         knows where my head is. And I like it that way. It’s less painful.”</p>
      <p>It was the truth. Staying messed up made things easy. An excuse. Dr Madison’s words
         floated back to him. You won’t make progress—until you want to.</p>
      <p>He gave her a sideways glance. Her lips turned down—her expression tragic. He waited
         for
         a sympathetic, bullshit comment, but she offered none. They sat knotted up, under
         the
         cover of darkness, making anything seem doable.</p>
      <p>She pressed deeper into his side and traced the inseam of his jeans with her thumb,
         tantalizing and tormenting him, at the same time. “The real you, wants me.”</p>
      <p>He couldn’t dispute it.</p>
      <p>“Let’s go for a swim.” She wormed her way out from under his arm and clambered to
         her
         feet. By the time he joined her, her shirt was half off.</p>
      <p>Laughing, he lowered the material. “No. There is no swimming in tonight’s
         itinerary.”</p>
      <p>Cassie’s chest rose and fell. His need for oxygen aligned with hers. He met her
         gaze.</p>
      <p>“You have such pretty eyes,” she whispered, her own eyes lidded, lashes fluttering.
         She
         inched closer.</p>
      <p>No longer strong enough to avoid the collision, he placed a cautious kiss on her lips
         and hungrily inhaled her tiny gasp. Then her arms were around him and the smell of
         smoke
         mingled with the scent of the lake as he buried his head into her neck. </p>
      <p>Fueled by the heat of her skin, he placed a gentle kiss on the spot where her pulse
         beat, then slowly slid his mouth across her cheek where the salty taste of tears
         shattered his pounding heart into a million pieces.</p>
      <p>Her hands slid under the back of his shirt, cool on his flushed body. She could do
         whatever she pleased. The need to kiss her emptied his thoughts and controlled his
         actions. He entwined his fingers into her hair, bringing her closer. For a few minutes,
         no one else existed in the world. Just him, Cassie, and Lake Michigan, its water lapping
         gently against the pier.</p>
      <p>Then he jerked his head up and stepped back. His lips were on Cassie. Caleb’s
         girlfriend—not his. Her dreamy expression lasted a couple of seconds, until the light
         bulb went off, and horror twisted the contentment of her features.</p>
      <p>“Oh, God!” She stumbled backward. “I'm sorry.”</p>
      <p>The mortified expression on her face was his fault. He raked his fingers through his
         hair. “It’s okay. I'm just…I'm just. Fuck. This is banjaxed.”</p>
      <p>Nothing was okay. His universe shifted, and he stood at the brink of some unfixable
         rift. The world as he knew it ended, and all he could think about was kissing her
         again.</p>
      <p>Right or wrong, he reached for her, but she took another step back. Fear clouded her
         eyes.</p>
      <p>“I don't feel good.” She pitched forward and heaved. The contents of her stomach
         splattered his shoes. She puked again, down her shirt, then began to cry.</p>
      <p>Without asking, he scooped her into his arms. He set her down, a pitiful heap, on
         the
         shore. Her shoulders rocked with soft sobs as she buried her head in her knees.</p>
      <p>“Hold on.” He needed his hoodie. When he got back, she was quiet. “Think you’ll puke
         again?” he asked, squatting to face her.</p>
      <p>She blinked like she couldn’t understand him.</p>
      <p>“Your shirts a sorry mess. It has to come off. You can wear my hoodie.”</p>
      <p>She whimpered as he pulled the neckline of her T-shirt wide beyond repair. She wore
         a
         lacy bra, for Cal’s benefit, no doubt. Anger jabbed his gut as he fed her arms through
         the sleeves of his hoodie, then zipped her up. He called a taxi, giving them an address
         somewhere between the party’s house number and his own.</p>
      <p> “You need to walk,” he prompted. “I know how to get to the street without anyone
         seeing
         us.”</p>
      <p>“Are you rescuing me?” she asked, as he led her down a breezeway. “Are you my knight
         in
         shining armor?”</p>
      <p>“No. Jaysus, Cassie.” No one ever accused him of that.</p>
      <p>How many times had he pulled this stunt on Caleb, getting so messed up he had to be
         led
         home? Yet Cal remained there for him. The irony was obvious. Sneaking off in a cab
         with
         Caleb’s girlfriend was not the greatest way to show appreciation.</p>
      <p>He draped his arm over her shoulder and stared out the taxi window as they slipped
         past
         his house, into the night.</p>
      <p>Solid, warm, and real, Cassie was the one rescuing him. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
