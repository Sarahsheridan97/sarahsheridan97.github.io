         <h4>Chapter 29</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Even with the air on in the pool house, the hair stuck to the back of Cassie’s neck.
         She
         swiveled the ice around her glass. It had all but disappeared, and the setting sun
         had
         done little to cool the temperature.</p>
      <p>She set the glass down and glanced at the clock. What was Caleb doing in the main
         house?
         He said he’d be five minutes, not fifteen.</p>
      <p>The door opened, and Caleb stepped in, dressed in white cotton pajama pants. Nothing
         else. His stomach muscles tightened, rippling his tanned skin as he lowered himself
         beside her, onto the sofa.</p>
      <p>“Ah, that’s better.” He motioned to his lack of attire. “Clothing needs to come off
         when
         it’s this hot.”</p>
      <p>Was that her cue to undress? It would be easier if he came right out and said something.
         A trail of fine, blond fuzz disappeared under his waistband. She was sure he wasn’t
         wearing anything underneath.</p>
      <p>“You’re staring at me,” he said, his gaze on the television. The light from the screen
         flickered across his features.</p>
      <p>“I'm envious.” It was doubtful he could hear the quiver in her voice. “Guys have such
         an
         advantage, being able to go topless.”</p>
      <p>A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. “What's stopping you?”</p>
      <p>That was unquestionably an invitation, and nothing was stopping her. Determined, she
         unbuttoned her shirt, working from the top down. It was no big deal. Her bra looked
         like
         a bathing suit, right? That's what James insisted when they ended up in the pool
         together, the sun rising around them.</p>
      <p>James.</p>
      <p>Guilt pinched her. He’d already seen her in her bra.</p>
      <p>She popped open the last two buttons. The silky material slid over her shoulders to
         the
         floor.</p>
      <p>“Hold on.” Caleb got up to lock the door then rejoined her on the sofa. He motioned
         for
         her to come closer, so she climbed on top and straddled his legs. He rested his hands
         on
         either side of her thighs, his eyes on her.</p>
      <p>Hands shaking, she reached back to unclasp her bra. The garment dropped to his lap
         and
         her breasts spilled out. Chilly conditioned air accosted her damp skin. She shivered
         as
         her nipples reacted to the temperature change.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s wide eyes rewarded her actions. His chest rose with his throaty inhale, but
         he
         didn’t touch her. Instead, he pulled a blanket from the back of the sofa and draped
         it
         over her shoulders.</p>
      <p>“You don't want me?” she teased, surprised by the seductiveness in her tone. She ground
         her bottom into his groin.</p>
      <p>Moaning, he traced the curve of her legs until his hands were under her shorts. He
         squeezed her butt. “I want you. Believe me.”</p>
      <p>From where she sat, it was obvious he wanted her. She continued to push against him,
         enjoying the sensation building between her legs and his breath, hot on her breasts.
         This wasn’t so bad. She had more control than she imagined. Caleb looked powerless
         right
         now.</p>
      <p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” He gripped her hips and stopped her from moving.
         “If
         you don’t, you need to stop what you're doing.”</p>
      <p>“I want to,” she said, as if in a trance. If they didn’t start soon, she might change
         her mind.</p>
      <p>Surprising her with his strength, he picked her up and flipped her on her back,
         sandwiching her between him and the sofa. He undid the button on her waistband and
         slid
         her shorts and panties past her hips, to her ankles.</p>
      <p>Any control she thought she had, disappeared. His lips pressed down on hers, his hands
         roamed her body. Caleb was a good kisser, but her thoughts scattered. She couldn’t
         concentrate enough to enjoy him.</p>
      <p>Being under him, against the cushioned back of the sofa made it hard to breathe. She
         fought the claustrophobic urge to push him off. That wouldn’t accomplish anything.
         She
         needed to do this. Sex would make them a couple.</p>
      <p>She slipped her hand under the front of his waistband and grasped his penis but didn’t
         know what to do with it. He grunted. She wasn’t sure if it was out of pleasure or
         pain.
         Or if he was turned on, or off, by her awkward exploration.</p>
      <p>He buried his head in her neck, shoulders against hers as he lowered his pants.</p>
      <p>Things were proceeding faster than she expected, but she had no idea how to slow them
         down, or what she was supposed to be doing. Would it be rude to say, ‘stop, let me
         examine your parts?’ The thought made her chuckle.</p>
      <p>“Are you laughing at me?” Caleb propped himself up on his elbows, chuckling as well.</p>
      <p>The foot of space between them allowed her to suck in more air and examine his face.
         He
         put up with her confusion and gave her time to come to this herself. She loved the
         serenity he brought into her life. He deserved this, especially after her recent error
         in judgment.</p>
      <p>He placed a soft kiss on her hand before laying it across her chest. His fingers trailed
         down her skin till they were between her legs. She gasped. Someone else’s hand down
         there felt alien.</p>
      <p>“It's okay.” He smiled against her lips. “I don't want to hurt you. This will help.”</p>
      <p>It didn’t. The idea seemed sexy, but his prodding fingers felt gigantic. And they
         were
         little in comparison to his penis. How would that ever fit in there?</p>
      <p>Giving up, Caleb maneuvered his body between her legs.</p>
      <p>Her heart pounded in her ears. Breathe. Relax. Breathe. She lifted her pelvis and
         wiggled, hoping it would help him somehow.</p>
      <p>After a few failed attempts, just when she thought it wasn’t going to happen, her
         body
         accepted him. It pinched when he entered, but there was no real pain. She brought
         her
         hand down to feel if he was all the way in. It was hard to tell, but based on his
         labored breathing and thrusting motions, it seemed to be working.</p>
      <p>This was happening. She wrapped her arms around his back, and let Caleb do his
         thing.</p>
      <p>After a few minutes, he slipped out and crouched over her. He did something she couldn't
         see, then slumped against the sofa, breathing hard.</p>
      <p>It was over. She pulled her knees together and waited, unsure what to do. Tears filled
         her eyes. She wasn't a virgin anymore. She brought her arm over her face to hide.</p>
      <p>Hiding behind his arm was something James did. She choked back a sob.</p>
      <p>Caleb nudged her knee. “The first time’s rough.” His breathing evened out, and he
         wiped
         his hands off with his pajama pants. “I promise it will get better.”</p>
      <p>She let him tuck the sheet around her. “I’m just kind of sad. It’s like I've
         changed.”</p>
      <p>“You have changed in a way.” He stood up, right in front of her. She shied away. Now
         that the moment passed, she craved space.</p>
      <p>“If it makes you feel better, that was a first for me too.” He pulled a pair of
         underwear out of the pile of laundry. “I’ve never had sex without a condom.”</p>
      <p>Damn. Where had her brain disappeared to? She’d rehearsed this scene so many times
         in
         her head, and it always involved a condom.</p>
      <p>“It's okay.” Caleb stood at the end of the sofa, still holding his underwear. “I came
         in
         my hand. I think that's why I went so quick. Skin on skin was way more intense.” He
         studied her for a second. “I’m going to shower. Is that okay?”</p>
      <p>It was more than okay. She nodded, happy to get dressed without his prying eyes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Alone, she lifted the sheet and used the leg of his pajamas to clean up. Everything
         looked the same but it wasn’t.</p>
      <p>Caleb called the experience intense, but not for her. It had been okay, maybe even
         pleasant after he’d made it in and found his rhythm. But she was glad it was over.
         Where
         were the goosebumps, the burning desire? Pleasant was okay, but was it enough?</p>
      <p>She dressed in her shorts but passed Caleb’s clean laundry pile to slip on a T-shirt
         out
         of James’ drawer. She drew the bottom of it up to wipe her eyes and was immersed in
         his
         scent. The heat, absent in her encounter with Caleb, rushed through her.</p>
      <p>She twisted her fingers in the hem of James’ T-shirt. </p>
      <p>Next time would be better.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>The door rattled, followed by frantic pounding. Cassie removed Caleb’s arm from her
         stomach and stretched for her phone. It was three in the morning. They’d fallen asleep
         on the sofa.</p>
      <p>“Wake up.” She shook Caleb. “Someone’s pounding.”</p>
      <p>Groaning he rubbed his eyes. He staggered to the door in his briefs and unlocked it.</p>
      <p>The door burst open. James tripped over the threshold, a blonde girl under his arm.
         His
         eyes floated over Cassie. “I knew you'd be here.”</p>
      <p>Caleb headed back to the sofa. “Then why are you here?” He pulled on a pair of shorts,
         under the girl’s hungry eyes. “Tell me you’re not driving?”</p>
      <p>“Uber,” James said. He dropped into the big armchair and pulled the girl on top of
         him.
         “Everybody, this is Roxanne. Roxanne is....”</p>
      <p>“Need an adjective,” Cassie mumbled.</p>
      <p>“Not twelve,” James fired back. He twisted around Roxanne to grin, but his smile faded
         as his gaze swept over Cassie’s chest. “Tell me you didn't have sex in my shirt?”</p>
      <p>“James.” Caleb motioned toward the kitchen alcove. “Talk. Now.”</p>
      <p>Shaking his head, James waved him off. “No more talk, Callie. I'm just here ‘cause
         I
         need a place to get my hole.” He kissed the back of Roxanne’s neck and slid his hand
         under her top.</p>
      <p>His hole? That was the rudest thing Cassie ever heard. Worse, Roxanne didn't seem
         to
         care. She turned to kiss him. Passionate kisses, her tongue in his mouth, her hands
         in
         his hair.</p>
      <p>Cassie couldn't look away.</p>
      <p>They parted long enough for James to slip his shirt over his head. He threw the shirt
         at
         Cassie. “Since you like my feckin clothing so much.”</p>
      <p>Caleb’s cheeks reddened. “Your stuff fits her better than mine.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t want your stinky shirt.” Cassie threw it back, but his lips were back on
         Roxanne’s, his eyes shut.</p>
      <p>Shifting, James yanked open the button of his jeans. “Want my feckin trousers, too?
         Roxy
         only wants what’s in them.”</p>
      <p>It should have been funny, but it wasn’t.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s mouth dropped open. “Holy fuck. James, stop. What are you trying to prove?”</p>
      <p>“Come on, baby.” James stood abruptly and Roxanne scrambled to her feet. Her fingers
         skimmed the bulge in his pants.</p>
      <p>Cassie wanted to shake her. Didn’t she care that he was out of it? It was unlikely
         he’d
         even remember her in the morning.</p>
      <p>James grabbed Roxanne’s wrist and led her to the bedroom. He reappeared seconds later
         and rummaged through the top cabinet drawer. He waved a foiled package at Cassie.
         “You
         know what these are? Don't you, luv?”</p>
      <p>“Caleb,” she batted her lashes at him, “you swore you didn’t have any condoms.” James
         could read that however he wanted.</p>
      <p>For a second James stood there, looking every bit as sick as she felt. Then he
         disappeared into the bedroom, slamming the door so hard the pictures shook.</p>
      <p>“I never said I didn’t have condoms.” Caleb chuckled. “I’m always on him about using
         them—especially when he's slumming.”</p>
      <p>“Slumming?”</p>
      <p>Caleb flipped stations, his ears red. “You know what he’s like.”</p>
      <p>She saw enough of James to know he mastered smoke screens and obnoxious comebacks.
         But
         how could anybody truly know someone who didn’t seem to understand themselves?</p>
      <p>“What?” Caleb sighed. “I'm just happy he didn't put the condom on right in front of
         us.”</p>
      <p>“Would you have stopped him?” She doubted it.</p>
      <p>He huffed. “Look Cassie, there’s something going on with him, he's not telling me,
         but
         when I figure it out, I'll make it right.” He motioned between the two of them. “I
         think
         he’s jealous of the time I spend with you.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe,” she said as laughter emanated from the back room. Laughter. What was he doing?
         “Do you mind if I go home?” she asked, already on her feet.</p>
      <p>“Whatever you want.” Caleb glanced at the bedroom door. “Want me to walk you?”</p>
      <p>“I'm okay.” For once, her bedroom would be a solace, not a prison.</p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
