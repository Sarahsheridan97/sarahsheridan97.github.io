         <h4>Chapter 6</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Cassie stepped from the darkness of the Logan Theater and blinked into the late
         afternoon sun. Heat rippled from the sidewalk, but it smelled like rain. She pulled
         at
         the collar of her shirt. July on her grandpa’s farm never felt this suffocating.</p>
      <p>Caleb touched her shoulder. “Admit it. You liked the movie.”</p>
      <p>Not wanting to burst his bubble, she nodded her approval. “How did I survive without
         Slasher Saturday?”</p>
      <p>The movie had been okay, but the best part was that they were alone. James wasn’t
         hanging over them, breathing down her neck, tying her stomach into knots.</p>
      <p>Spending the last week stuck between the two of them required patience. James seemed
         to
         enjoy making her mad enough to say something rude, just so Caleb would get annoyed
         with
         her and be forced to choose sides.</p>
      <p>The last movie they saw, James insisted on tagging along. As soon as the lights dimmed,
         he retrieved a flask from his pocket and got so drunk and obnoxious they were asked
         to
         leave. Caleb didn’t seem angry then, but he avoided bringing him this time.</p>
      <p>“How are your classes going?” Caleb leaned against the theater’s brick façade, hands
         in
         his pockets, allowing her time to get her bearings and lead the way home—a game he
         made
         up to teach her the city.</p>
      <p>“I'm meeting a lot of people. At least I won't feel like a stranger this fall.” She
         studied the opposite direction. There had to be a landmark somewhere, but the area
         held
         no clues, not even a street sign.</p>
      <p>He chuckled. “You have no idea where you are, do you?”</p>
      <p>They caught a taxi there, and she was texting Allison, not paying attention. She faced
         him and shrugged.</p>
      <p>“Do you want me to tell you where the lake is?” Caleb straightened up. “Or point you
         toward the blue line?”</p>
      <p>Her stomach growled. “Let's get cupcakes at Molly's. Aren't we close enough to walk?”
         It
         was a stab in the dark.</p>
      <p>“Molly’s is east of here, Cassie.” He tugged at his bottom lip, unable to hide his
         amusement. “We're on the other side of the Kennedy.”</p>
      <p>She checked the skyline. James insisted if she looked at the tops of the buildings,
         she
         would never be lost. To prove his point, he rattled off skyscraper names while pointing
         at their rooflines, surprising her and Caleb with how many he recognized.</p>
      <p>“That way is south.” She gestured to her right. “Which means it’s the way home.”</p>
      <p>“Correct.” Caleb looped his arm over her shoulder as they headed down Milwaukee. “And
         I
         know of a little diner with great food and fast service not much farther down the
         street.”</p>
      <p>She relaxed into his side, enjoying his undivided attention.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Fifties rock blasted from the crowded restaurant. Caleb led her past a row of occupied
         bar stools to a shiny, laminated booth. “They have great shakes here.”</p>
      <p>Red vinyl cooled her bare legs as she slipped across from him. She looped her ankles
         around his calf. Though it was busy, the waitress appeared instantaneous.</p>
      <p>“I’m not that hungry,” she lied, “but can we split a strawberry shake?” It seemed
         like a
         relationship thing, and secretly something she always wanted to do.</p>
      <p>Caleb ordered the shake, a coffee, and a piece of apple pie with two forks, then pulled
         his cell from his pants pocket. “Hope the world hasn't gone to hell,” he said, unmuting
         his phone.</p>
      <p>More like he hoped James hadn't. A comment she bit back.</p>
      <p>The waitress returned. Caleb slid the shake to the middle of the table and bent a
         straw
         toward her. “Go ahead.” He flashed his dimples, then took a drink.</p>
      <p>She leaned forward. Lumps of ice cream blocked the straw. She finally managed to get
         a
         taste when Caleb’s phone beeped, no doubt James’ calling to claim her boyfriend. She
         snatched the phone and sat against the seat. His locked phone offered no clues if
         her
         guess was right.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” Caleb retreated from the shake.</p>
      <p>“Checking your messages. That's okay, isn’t it?” Didn’t couples answer each other’s
         phones all the time? She extended the device over the table. “Can you unlock it?”</p>
      <p>He obliged her, then sat back. With crossed arms and knit brows he waited.</p>
      <p>“You have a snap,” she informed him, as she scrolled his notifications. “It’s from
         James. Can I delete it without looking?” They’d been James-free for less than four
         hours. It wasn’t fair.</p>
      <p>Caleb laughed but shook his head.</p>
      <p>A selfie of James and some girl filled the screen. They held shot glasses, Caleb’s
         pool
         in the background. Get home, the caption read.</p>
      <p>The last thing she wanted to do was hang with James while he molested some poor girl.
         She dropped the phone into Caleb’s outstretched hand and finished the shake while
         he
         checked his phone.</p>
      <p>“Looks like I'm having a party,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There goes our evening.” She leaned back. “Why do you always have to keep tabs on
         him?”</p>
      <p>“You've seen what happens when I don't.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t her boyfriend’s job to keep his friend safe. She sighed, loud enough to
         make
         her feelings known.</p>
      <p>“Anyway.” Caleb ate a forkful of pie. “Didn’t I get a lecture from you about wanting
         to
         go to parties?” He pushed the plate toward her and reached for his coffee. “We've
         been
         watching a lot of TV. I feel fat.”</p>
      <p>“Fat? You could model with those abs.”</p>
      <p>Caleb choked on his coffee.</p>
      <p>“Are you okay?” She handed him a napkin.</p>
      <p>“Sorry. That must have gone down the wrong way.” He went back to his phone.</p>
      <p>Cassie grabbed a fork. Her parents were returning tomorrow, but their vacation had
         morphed into a week. Last night saw the end of the pizza rolls, and this morning she
         ate
         the last egg, without toast. Not wanting Caleb or his mom to feel required to feed
         her,
         she kept her mouth shut about her dwindling food supplies.</p>
      <p>“Ready?” Caleb set a twenty-dollar bill under the corner of the plate and moved to
         the
         edge of the booth.</p>
      <p>“Wait.” She grabbed his hand. “Can’t we do something else tonight. Alone?”</p>
      <p>For all the time she spent with Caleb, he hadn’t pushed past the kissing stage, and
         as
         pleasant as that was, she’d rather get the, lose your virginity stage over with so
         she
         could move onto the, firmly planted in your life, part.</p>
      <p>His eyes widened with understanding. “I’m enjoying how slow this is going.” He tugged
         her from the booth. “I like that you do the little stuff with me. We have time for
         other
         stuff later.”</p>
      <p>A sentiment she would have loved to hear last year—from Paul. But not now. Not from
         Caleb.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Raindrops dotted the taxi windows on the ride home. James’ black Mustang occupied
         Caleb’s driveway, along with another car. A strong indicator the intermittent drizzle
         hadn’t ruined the festivities like Cassie hoped.</p>
      <p>The faint beat of a bass line echoed from the backyard. She waited while Caleb opened
         the Mustang's door. He checked the ignition, then the visor. “Damn it. James has the
         keys.”</p>
      <p>He slammed the door and headed to the gate.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Two thin, blonde girls occupied the cushioned chairs around the pool, while a
         dark-haired girl, her tight curls cut in a super short pixie, goofed off in the water
         with Ron. Cassie did the math. Three boys and three girls—making her the odd one out.
         A
         typical James’ move.</p>
      <p>James grinned from where he relaxed on a lounger, legs on either side, shirt open.
         His
         red, white, and blue trunks carried a crested logo.</p>
      <p>Caleb hugged the blondes then kicked the foot of James’ chair. “Where’s Mom?”</p>
      <p>“Inside.” James shot Cassie a glance. “She said we could have a couple beers if we
         stayed put.”</p>
      <p>Caleb picked up a bottle that read ‘Voodoo Tiki’ and scowled at the back of his house.
         “Being this close to her when we’re getting wrecked is a serious buzz kill.”</p>
      <p>Another buzz kill, Cassie wanted to say, was when your boyfriend fails to introduce
         you
         to their beautiful female company. She considered herself pretty, but these girls
         were
         gorgeous. Refusing to look hurt, she crossed her arms and smiled as Caleb retreated
         across the grass to the coverage of the vined perogola.</p>
      <p>“Chill out, dude,” James called after him. He swung his leg over the cushion and stood.
         “You forgot to introduce your girlfriend. Come over here, angel.”</p>
      <p>The word angel produced a nasty glare from the girl with poker straight hair, an obvious
         warning to stay away. Cassie stared back. She wasn’t interested in James or fooled
         by
         his bogus attempt at chivalry.</p>
      <p>James brushed past her. “That's Alexa.” He pointed to the unhappy blonde girl. “And
         Lauren. Nia’s in the pool.” Nia splashed water at him. He waved a naughty finger in
         response. “Everyone, this is Cassie.”</p>
      <p>At least he didn’t introduce her as 'angel,’ Every time he called her that, she heated
         into a blush. Probably the exact reason he did it.</p>
      <p>He flipped into the deep end, shirt on, leaving her alone on the deck. She gave everyone
         a slight wave, not that any of them noticed, then headed across the yard after
         Caleb.</p>
      <p>“Sorry for not introducing you,” he said as she approached. “It creeps me out that
         my
         mom might be watching.” He took a drink of the blue liquid then winced. “She can’t
         see
         me here.”</p>
      <p>“We can move to my backyard. Just the two of us.” Her house sat, empty as usual. “No
         one
         is watching me.”</p>
      <p>“I’m watching,” he whispered into her ear, then pulled her into a tight hug. A sweet
         sentiment, and exactly what she needed.</p>
      <p>Commotion in the pool caught her attention. Nia had wrapped herself around James and
         pulled at his shirt. Alexa jumped into the water, almost on top of them. As if he
         could
         feel her watching, James looked up. He gave her a wicked grin, then dove under. Nia
         shrieked before disappearing beneath the water.</p>
      <p>Caleb stepped back. “Can we move this party to your house? I'll feel less like I'm
         being
         spied on—if I'm not being spied on.”</p>
      <p>That was a definite no. “My parents get home tomorrow. They’d kill me.”</p>
      <p>“They'd never know.”</p>
      <p>Those big blue eyes of his could beg all night, but she wasn't inviting these strangers
         into her home. Wrapping her arms around Caleb’s neck, she said, “You, can come over.
         I
         won’t be able to see you tomorrow. I’ve got plans with my dad.”</p>
      <p>Something cold splattered her back and she jerked around. James stood behind her,
         shaking water from himself like a dog.</p>
      <p>“Ew.” She ran her hands over her arms.</p>
      <p>“Holy feck.” James laughed. “It’s pool water, not piss.” He swiped away the rogue
         drops
         rolling down his cheeks, then pointed to the bottle in Caleb’s hand. “Ronnie wants
         to
         play caps for tequila shots.”</p>
      <p>“Shit,” Caleb said, “You always win at that game.”</p>
      <p>Cassie latched onto Caleb’s arm. “Aren’t we going to my house?”</p>
      <p>“I need to stay here, Cassie.” Caleb handed over the bottle. “Sorry.”</p>
      <p>A satisfied grin spread across James' face. “Sweet. Go put some shorts on. Ron’s
         waiting, already.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie remained under the pergola while Caleb changed. It wasn't like the trio of
         girls
         wanted anything to do with her. Lauren seemed approachable but shared a chaise with
         Nia
         who laughed drunkenly at something on Lauren’s phone. To Cassie’s surprise, they
         kissed.</p>
      <p>Alexa continued to scowl. At least Ron was there. Short and stocky with cropped brown
         hair, he resembled the guys back home, not someone out of a magazine.</p>
      <p>James hit a switch and soft, overhead lights brightened the darkening yard. He
         positioned himself on the pavers at an angle from Ron, and like Ron, stretched his
         legs
         into a V. He placed an empty beer bottle between his thighs and set an upside-down
         beer
         cap on top.</p>
      <p>She hedged closer.</p>
      <p>“Do they play this in Kansas?” James asked, stacking the bottle caps Alexa brought
         him.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” she said, though she’d never seen the game before and could count the number
         of
         alcohol-related parties she’d attended on one hand.</p>
      <p>The corner of his mouth twitched. “Let’s see your moves.”</p>
      <p>She hung back. “I’m good here.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll show you my moves,” Alexa offered.</p>
      <p>“Come on,” James persisted, “show me how the culchies party in Kansas.”</p>
      <p>“I think Kansas is a great state,” Nia offered.</p>
      <p>“James,” Caleb warned as he approached. He’d changed into cargo shorts and a University
         of Notre Dame t-shirt. James flipped a cap at him. It hit the leprechaun logo square
         on.</p>
      <p>“Remember.” Caleb pulled a chair alongside the game and motioned for Cassie to sit.
         “You
         promised to be nice.” He plopped down, facing the others like the third point of a
         triangle.</p>
      <p>“Relax, Callie.” James lit a cigarette and let it dangle from the corner of his mouth.
         “She knows I’m slagging her.</p>
      <p>Caleb chuckled. “You better hope Mom doesn’t see that thing.”</p>
      <p>“I keep telling you. She’s not watching.” James didn't sound concerned but lifted
         his
         eyes to the back of the house. “Besides, I play better when I smoke.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>An hour into the game, Ron crawled to the bushes and puked. “I’m okay,” he said, as
         he
         collapsed into a heap on the grass. “Just going to lie here a while.”</p>
      <p>Caleb burst into laughter but didn’t look any better. He was going to lose, or perhaps
         already lost. Cassie wasn't sure what the rules were, or if the game was over.</p>
      <p>“Here, Caleb.” Alexa sat behind James; her long, bare legs stretched on either side
         of
         his. “I'll handicap him for you.” She helped herself to the cigarette dangling between
         his lips and took a drag before replacing it.</p>
      <p>James inched forward but chided, “You're going to have to do more than sit if you
         want
         to handicap me.”</p>
      <p>The challenge brought a smile to Alexa’s face. She slipped her hands into his bathing
         suit pockets.</p>
      <p>Still seated at the end of the lounge, Lauren glanced up from her phone. “Nice, Alexa.
         Real classy.” She pushed Nia’s legs off. The girl moaned but didn’t wake up.</p>
      <p>James jerked his elbow into his crotch. “Darling, don’t touch me there. That is my
         no-no
         square.”</p>
      <p>The motion in his shorts ignited Cassie’s cheeks. She glared at him. Did they not
         have
         any sense of decency?</p>
      <p>A beer cap bounced off James’ head. “Play now, screw later.” Caleb raised another
         cap.</p>
      <p>“You should quit while you can still walk, Cal—and you,” he bumped back into Alexa,
         “can
         save it for another time.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t patronize me.” Caleb placed a cap on top of his bottle, half over the rim.
         “Take
         your damn shot.”</p>
      <p>James sighed, but shot. Caleb’s cap hit the ground.</p>
      <p>“Fuck.” Caleb struggled to his feet.</p>
      <p>Cassie shot James a dirty look and sprung to Caleb’s aid.</p>
      <p>“Fucking guy.” He grabbed her arm. “I can never beat him at this game.” He staggered
         toward the house, her arm tight in his grasp.</p>
      <p>She stumbled up the back steps and broke free in the middle of the kitchen.</p>
      <p>“Cal. Is that you?” Elizabeth rounded the corner. “Oh.” Her hand rose to her throat.
         “James insisted he only had a six pack.”</p>
      <p>“Well, Mom, he was wrong.” Caleb leaned on the center island for support. “Imagine
         that.
         James wrong. Will the sun rise tomorrow?” Arms spread, he stumbled backward. “By the
         way, Cassie wants to spend the night.”</p>
      <p>“I was only bringing him to the door, Mrs. Patterson.” She wanted more intimacy, but
         there was no way she would follow him to his room with his mom watching. Besides,
         from
         the expression on Elizabeth's face, that wasn’t an option.</p>
      <p>“Cassie's heading home,” Elizabeth said. She crossed to the door as if she planned
         to
         check outside, then changed her mind. “What sort of shape is James in?”</p>
      <p>Cassie shrugged. James seemed sober, but his many states of inebriation confused
         her.</p>
      <p>“Did the other girls leave? I don't want them staying in the pool house.”</p>
      <p>Under different circumstances, Cassie would have laughed. She was pretty sure it was
         a
         little late to worry about James' virtue.</p>
      <p>“I think they left.” She glanced at Caleb, but he wasn’t in any shape to offer input.
         “See you later, Mrs. Patterson.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie eyed her house from the top step. In utter darkness, it was as far from warm
         and
         inviting as it could get. Her stomach sank at the thought of trying to sleep there,
         alone. Caleb didn’t realize how lucky he was to have a mom who worried about him.</p>
      <p>She descended the stairs. Alexa’s legs were still around James' hips and Lauren and
         Nia
         hadn’t moved from the lounge.</p>
      <p>James ground out his cigarette then faced Alexa. She chirped in surprise as he lifted
         her and laid her on the pavers, pinning her with his body.</p>
      <p>“Alexa, stop flirting. I have to go.” Lauren sounded sober. She stroked Nia’s arm.
         “We’re leaving.”</p>
      <p>In one fluid motion, James got to his feet. He stretched his arms behind his head
         and
         yawned. His gaze landed on Cassie.</p>
      <p>Alexa glared at her. “Don't you live over there?” She pointed to Cassie’s house. “Why
         don’t you run along. It’s past your bedtime.”</p>
      <p>Lauren appeared apologetic, but Alexa was horrible. Cassie wouldn’t hang out with
         them
         if they paid her. She took a few steps, intent on leaving, when James clamped his
         fingers around her wrist.</p>
      <p>“Go home,” he said to Alexa. “I'll call you later.”</p>
      <p>Alexa clambered to her feet. “Fuck you, James. Don’t call till you’ve grown up enough
         to
         want a woman.”</p>
      <p>She pushed past Cassie and disappeared behind the garage. Her friends followed,
         laughing. The gate slammed shut, leaving Cassie alone with James—again. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
