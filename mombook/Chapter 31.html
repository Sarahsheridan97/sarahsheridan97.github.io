         <h4>Chapter 31</h4>
      </div>
      <p>Cassie stopped at home to shower and changed into a swimsuit and cut off shorts. Nobody
         was there to notice her night’s absence. No surprise. Shaking off the sinking feeling
         of
         abandonment, she looked out her window. Caleb was in his pool. Her disappearance hadn’t
         altered his swim routine either.</p>
      <p>Caleb was in the shallow end as she trudged across his yard. He gave her a quick wave
         then tugged red goggles over his eyes before diving under. She dangled her feet in
         the
         cool blue water and waited. When he surfaced, he held a green diving ring that he
         pitched to the side.</p>
      <p>“Sorry. I haven’t had much time for you this week,” he said as he pulled himself out
         to
         sit beside her. He pushed the goggles to his forehead and smiled, broad and unassuming.
         “I called last night.”</p>
      <p>“I went to bed early.” The lie hurt her stomach, but she managed an even tone and
         met
         his gaze. Tufts of hair stuck out around the band of the goggles; his eyes, as clear
         as
         the sky behind him. He was cute, dependable, and hers. Everything she needed.</p>
      <p>He raised an eyebrow, but his smile seemed sincere. “Are you okay with… everything?
         We
         can go back to holding hands.”</p>
      <p>“I don't want to go backward.” She laced her fingers with his. Her boyfriend. The
         guy
         who wanted her.</p>
      <p>Tension melted from his shoulders. “When you didn't answer last night, I thought you
         were mad at me for not calling.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not mad.” Cute and dependable was better than crazy and confused, even if Crazy
         was
         so hot, he burnt like wildfire, consuming everything in sight.</p>
      <p>Besides, Crazy didn’t want her.</p>
      <p>She squeezed Cute and Dependable’s hand. “You look happy.”</p>
      <p>“Just feeling lucky.” He laid back, his legs still in the pool, and closed his eyes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Caleb’s gate banged shut. Cassie exhaled when Ron emerged from the corner of the garage,
         though her relief it wasn’t James was bound to be short lived. She’d have to see him
         sometime.</p>
      <p>Ron eyed her as he passed, his slight grin akin to a used car salesman. He dumped
         the
         contents of his pockets onto a metal side table and kicked off his slides. Beads of
         sweat glistened on his shirtless chest.</p>
      <p>His gaze slid to Caleb. “Where’s James?”</p>
      <p>Caleb released her hand. “Why does everyone assume I always know where he is?”</p>
      <p>Chuckling, Ron eased himself into the shallow end. Arms wrapped around his torso,
         he
         faced her. “How ‘bout you, Cassie? Do you know where he is?”</p>
      <p>The question punched her like a bolt of electricity. Ron’s grin widened.</p>
      <p>“You get into the water like a girl, Ronald,” Caleb said before she could answer.
         Defense she didn’t deserve. “Go swim in your own pool.”</p>
      <p>Still grinning, Ron flipped Caleb off. “My dad got mad at the pool guy. Our backyard
         now
         resembles a science experiment.” He climbed out as carefully as he got in, then
         stretched across a chaise. He waved his phone in the air. “You need to check this
         out,
         dude.”</p>
      <p>Sitting had become painful. She stepped out of her shorts then slid into the deep
         end.</p>
      <p>After four lengths of freestyle, the gate slammed shut again. Between strokes, she
         caught a glimpse of ratty Converse, and ankles covered in now-familiar ink. She
         concentrated on her stroke, but something interfered with the correct execution of
         her
         flip turn. Her feet touched bottom. She straightened, sputtering.</p>
      <p>“Hi, Cassie.” The corner of James’ undone shirt dipped into the pool as he leaned
         beside
         her to test the water. The scent of soap lingered on his chest. The word Unity popped
         into her brain.</p>
      <p>She adjusted her bikini straps and willed herself not to look at his abdomen. His
         arrival had caught Ron’s attention, but Caleb didn’t give him so much as a glance.</p>
      <p>“I think you're being ignored,” she said.</p>
      <p>James waved his hand in front of her face. “By Cal—or by you?”</p>
      <p>He leaned closer, to push away one of the floating lights. “Cal’s pissed at me for
         my
         recent disappearing act. What’s funny is he couldn’t find me, but you did. How long
         have
         you been here, anyway?”</p>
      <p>“A bit. Why?”</p>
      <p>“No reason.” He dropped his shirt onto the deck and strode to the deep end.</p>
      <p>Cassie leaned back, against the ledge, heartbeat in her ears as he ascended the diving
         board. He raised both brows at her before he dove.</p>
      <p>She moved over and resumed her laps. But her concentration was blown.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Although he’d been awake when Cassie left, James took his time going to Caleb’s. He
         needed a spacer between his night with Cassie and talking to Caleb. Time to get his
         head
         around what he allowed to happen—and move on.</p>
      <p>Because he had to.</p>
      <p>He stripped his bed, then showered. After that, he practiced guitar riffs until his
         fingers were numb, and dreaming up chord variations were the single thought in his
         head.</p>
      <p>At that point, and only at that point, did he feel controlled enough to see Cal.</p>
      <p>Of course, she was there.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Unable to avoid things any longer, James climbed out of the pool and crossed the pavers.
         He plopped onto one of the chairs and waited.</p>
      <p>“Wow, Ronnie.” Caleb jutted his chin in James’ direction. “Look who’s decided to grace
         us with his presence.”</p>
      <p>“Where have you been?” Ron asked before James could utter a word.</p>
      <p>“Great.” James huffed. “You have Ronnie on my tail, now?” Five minutes in the yard
         and
         he wanted to punch the guy.</p>
      <p>“Relax, asshole.” Ron leaned back; ankles crossed. “I don't give a shit what happens
         to
         you. But I need a favor.”</p>
      <p>“A favor?”</p>
      <p>“I want you to set me up with that girl.”</p>
      <p>James spat out a laugh. “You’re slagging me, right? What girl?”</p>
      <p>Cassie climbed out of the pool. She adjusted her bottoms and padded across the pavers
         to
         lean over the back of Cal’s chair, her breasts spilling out the top of her bikini.</p>
      <p>Breasts he’d refused to taste, even though they had been in his face; the left one
         a
         little bigger, the right one freckled. He studied the front legs of Caleb’s chair,
         loosely aware of Caleb pulling Cassie onto his knee.</p>
      <p>“Hey.” Caleb snapped his fingers in front of James’ face. “He’s talking about the
         girls
         from the beach. The ones we played volleyball with… Remember? One was all over you?”
         Cal’s voice hitched the way it did when he lied.</p>
      <p>James remembered, but gave Cal a blank stare, letting him stew. He hadn’t liked the
         redhead, whatever her name was, and couldn’t get a visual on her friend.</p>
      <p>Caleb chuckled, but his cheeks were pink and his forehead glossy. “Ronnie bumped into
         them again, last night. Somehow, they started talking about us. The one Ron likes,
         wants
         you. Go figure.”</p>
      <p>“Fuck you. I’m the one with the birthday invite. Tonight, at her lake house.” Ron
         held
         out his phone, but James refused it. She insisted I bring you, and you’re clearly
         not
         interested. So I figure come, be your usual I-don’t-give-a-shit, pretentious self.
         She’ll be heartbroken and I’ll come to her rescue.”</p>
      <p>Caleb examined him. “You’re not interested, right?”</p>
      <p>“What did she look like?” James tried harder to conjure an image of her, but the water
         dripping from Cassie’s hair had pooled between her breasts.</p>
      <p>“She’s blonde, James.” Ron sounded exasperated. “Her name is Mary. Hello. Does any
         of
         this ring a bell?”</p>
      <p>It didn’t. The evening was a blur, other than Caleb slept with the redhead. That part
         was hard to forget. He shrugged. “I’d just got out of rehab, Cal.”</p>
      <p>“You have serious memory issues.” Ron tapped his own head with his forefinger. “You
         might want to go get a CAT scan or something.”</p>
      <p>Not giving a damn what Ron thought, James shrugged at Caleb again.</p>
      <p> “Give it a rest.” Caleb glared at Ron. “If he doesn’t remember, he doesn’t remember.
         All the better for you.”</p>
      <p>James closed his eyes. Once things were smoothed over, he would do what Caleb said.
         A
         strategy that worked for years.</p>
      <p>“How’s your memory, Cal?” Ron asked. “I’m sure you remember one redhead in
         particular?”</p>
      <p>James jerked to attention. Caleb’s tanned complexion turned white.</p>
      <p>Cassie grimaced, but she seemed more disgusted than angry. “This whole conversation
         is
         ridiculous.” She sighed, but she was ruffled, it was easy to see. “Caleb can talk
         to
         other girls. Stop being such a jerk, Ron.”</p>
      <p>“Ooh.” Appearing withered, Ron placed his hand on his heart. “When you stop being
         a
         naïve little bitch, Cassie.”</p>
      <p>James sprang to his feet. He booted the leg of Ron’s chair. “Get up, asshole.”</p>
      <p>Every inch of him hummed to drive his fists into Ron and make him pay for his words.
         Why
         the hell was Cal still sitting there?</p>
      <p>“James! Suigh siʹos.” Caleb removed Cassie from his knee and stood between them. </p>
      <p>“Shit, Caleb.” Still in his chair, Ron sputtered out a laugh. “Call off your puppy.”</p>
      <p>“You must want an ass kicking.” Caleb said, his fingers dug firmly into James’
         shoulders. “Shut up.”</p>
      <p>James strained against Caleb’s grip. “You’re going to let this piece of shite insult
         your girlfriend like that?”</p>
      <p>Cassie stood off to the side—tiny, wet, and wide eyed. He hadn’t meant to terrify
         her.</p>
      <p>“James. I’ve got this.” Caleb tried to chase down his gaze. “Ronnie, apologize. Don't
         call my girlfriend names.”</p>
      <p>“Sorry, Cassie.” Ron raised a brow. “I didn’t realize James had taken such an active
         interest in you.”</p>
      <p>“Bhfuil tu’ chomh marbh!” James lunged forward.</p>
      <p>Caleb’s full weight pushed back. “You’ll have to go through me, if you plan on killing
         him.”</p>
      <p>He’d never go through Cal. Ever.</p>
      <p>“Breathe,” Caleb said. “Tell me when I can step down.”</p>
      <p>A moment passed, the silence heavy, until James swung his gaze to Caleb. “I’m good.
         Let
         go of me. Jaysus.”</p>
      <p>Ears burning, he stomped toward the pool house. Cassie may not be his responsibility,
         but he planned to shut Caleb's affair with Red down, before it blindsided her.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cassie let out a sigh. Never in her life had she seen anyone go from relaxed to
         homicidal in under ten seconds, in her defense. It would have been nice to have James
         by
         her side when she lived in Kansas. Paul would have crapped his pants.</p>
      <p>Caleb pulled her onto his lap, but the seat wasn’t as cozy after Ron’s redhead
         comments.</p>
      <p>“What the shit? I didn't think I said anything he’d react like that to. I was teasing.”
         Still pale, Ron leaned back. “You don't find it a little… odd that—”</p>
      <p>She winced, but Caleb groaned. “I know what you’re going to say. Cassie spent time
         in
         the hospital with James. They became friends. End of story.”</p>
      <p>Ron’s eyes slid over her, assessing. He hmphed. “There goes my chance of getting any
         favors out of him.”</p>
      <p>“Well, that would serve you right.” Caleb wrapped his arms about her. “Give him some
         time. He’s not that mad or you’d be in a world of pain right now. And there’d have
         been
         nothing I could have done about it.”</p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
