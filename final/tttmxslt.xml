         <h4>Chapter 1</h4>
         <p>James’ bicep twitched as the makeup artist rubbed another layer of concealer over the
            letters FTW scrolled across his left forearm. She worked downward, toward his wrist
            where his favorite tat, a depiction of Van Gogh’s skull smoking a joint, camouflaged a
            fair amount of scar tissue.</p>
         <p>He would never have taken this modeling gig had he known they would censor his ink, and
            his wrist was the last place he wanted to be groped.</p>
         <p>With a slow inhale he planted his feet flat on the floor and focused on the hum of the
            industrial fan. After seven years of therapy, he ought to be able to calm himself
            down—without dissociating. But he couldn’t.</p>
         <p>His heart thudded and despite the circulating air, the room grew warmer by the minute.
            He needed help.</p>
         <p>Luckily, it was close by.</p>
         <p>With a slight twist, he attempted to make urgent eye contact with his friend Caleb who
            sat one chair over, dressed, ready for the photo shoot.</p>
         <p>But Caleb, who always had James’ back, missed the SOS.</p>
         <p>Instead, he stared downward, toward his knees, at the open pages of a discarded
            Cosmopolitan magazine. Weird reading material, even for Caleb, but something had been
            off with him since school let out for summer. He was too quiet, even distant, and no
            matter how much James tried, two weeks of prying hadn’t loosened Cal’s tongue.</p>
         <p>James cleared his throat—but got nothing. His stomach tightened.</p>
         <p>“Stay still, por favor.” The woman frowned as her fingers skimmed Van Gogh. “Almost
            done.”</p>
         <p>A familiar shiver trickled down James’ spine. One he’d been taught to notice. A warning.
            He needed out of the chair. Now. Before she asked what happened to his wrist—or didn’t
            ask—and assumed the worst.</p>
         <p>Slouching forward, hand on his groin, he flashed his most persuasive smile. “Skip that
            one…” He scanned her lanyard. “Cierra. I’ve gotta piss.”</p>
         <p>She glanced at his pants but shook her head. “You’re not moving ‘til I finish your
            arm.”</p>
         <p>Trapped.</p>
         <p>The air around him tightened. His body teetered weightless as his mind fought for
            distance.</p>
         <p>In a last-ditch attempt at staying corporeal he doodled circles on the smooth surface of
            the mirrored vanity, with the index finger of his free hand. Another grounding
            technique, straight from his shrink.</p>
         <p>The exercise helped until Cierra thumbed the patch of skin still sensitive from nerve
            damage. Nausea rolled over him and a tiny whimper squeezed through his clamped jaw.</p>
         <p>Screw grounding himself. Dr. Madison didn’t know shit. If he didn’t disconnect, he’d
            knock Cierra on her ass. Once he spaced out, she could do what she wanted with his
            body.</p>
         <p>A familiar haze crept over him.</p>
         <p>“James. Stay with us.” With a loud sigh, Caleb let the magazine slide from his knees. He
            thumped over it as he rolled closer. “Stop messing with him. I heard your instructions.
            Cover everything R rated, leave the rest.”</p>
         <p>The tightness in James’ chest lightened. Help at last.</p>
         <p>“What does Nár laga Dia do lámh, mean?” Cierra’s Spanish tongue slaughtered the Irish
            verse twisted around a Celtic cross; its’ bottom point suspended above Van Gogh.</p>
         <p>“Leave it.” Caleb’s voice was flat.</p>
         <p>“May God not weaken your hand,” James answered, the conversation a means to keep him in
            his body, on planet Earth.</p>
         <p>Where—according to everyone—he needed to be.</p>
         <p>Cierra selected a foundation brush from the adjacent table. “All these tattoos must
            limit your work opportunities.”</p>
         <p>“Bloody hell, Cal.” James closed his eyes as the brush assaulted his skin, but he was no
            longer on high alert. He’d passed that torch to Cal. “I’ll never be gainfully employed.
            Whatever will I do?”</p>
         <p>Caleb chuckled.</p>
         <p>Cierra didn’t. She tapped the serpent on the inside of his right forearm. “I do like the
            snake, though.”</p>
         <p>Twisted into a knot and dangling a clover from its mouth, the serpent was James’ biggest
            tattoo. It hid a long, straight scar—newer than the rest—but like most of his others, he
            was clueless how he got it.</p>
         <p>Not that he cared.</p>
         <p>He turned toward Cierra’s voice. “All the girls like my snake, CiCi.” He waited for
            Cal’s rebuke, reining him in, telling him he’d gone too far, but got nothing.</p>
         <p>“Keep your eyes—and mouth—closed, chaval.” Cierra shielded his nose and blasted his arm
            with setting spray.</p>
         <p>He knocked her hand away. “I’m eighteen. Legal. In case you were… curious.” He wasn’t
            eighteen yet, but she didn't know that.</p>
         <p>“All done.” Her voice came from his right. “They’re still setting up in the next room.
            Give your arms a minute to set, then get dressed. They’ll send for you guys, soon.”</p>
         <p>James kept his eyes closed but smiled. He’d managed his stress without dissociating.
            Sure, he had some help, but only a wee bit. Now that it was over, he felt certain he
            could have handled it on his own.</p>
         <p>He sucked in a breath and exhaled, rolling the remaining tension from his shoulders.
            “What do you think, Callie? You’re staring holes through me. Do I look as prom worthy as
            you?”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s seat squeaked. “How would you know what I’m looking at? Your eyes are shut.”</p>
         <p>James opened his eyes. Sure enough, Cierra stood at the other table, cleaning her
            supplies, and as he guessed, Caleb stared at him from his chair, his happy pink shirt
            and white cummerbund at odds with the tightness in his jaw.</p>
         <p>“How would you know my eyes were shut if you weren’t looking?” It was unarguable logic
            and he waited for a smart-ass reply, but Caleb only scratched the back of his neck and
            turned toward the long wall of windows. They were high enough up to see Lake Michigan,
            sandwiched between Chicago’s metal skyline. Scenic, sure, but it didn’t warrant more
            than a two-second glance.</p>
         <p>James unstuck himself from the sweaty confines of the chair’s black vinyl and scooped up
            the Cosmo magazine. Are you an enabler? the cover enquired. He dropped it on Cierra’s
            table then strolled across the wood floor, toward a metal rack containing the required
            outfits. The first shirt tagged for him, Fitzpatrick, was black with silver pinstripes.
            He slipped it on, leaving it unbuttoned.</p>
         <p>“Keep the sleeves loose for now.” Cierra’s gaze lingered on his Irish Republican Army
            tattoo, half-visible above the low waistband of his trousers. Her complexion darkened.
            “So, how long have you two been a couple?”</p>
         <p>“I like women.” James sat down. “Older ones.” He pushed his hips forward, letting the
            flat front pants illustrate his package.</p>
         <p>“We’re brothers,” Caleb offered, still facing the windows.</p>
         <p>They weren’t brothers and looked nothing alike. But James smiled at the term of
            endearment Cal picked up from the three and a half years James lived with him, courtesy
            of the Department of Children and Family Services.</p>
         <p>“Twins,” James added, “identical.” He searched Cierra’s face for a reaction.</p>
         <p>She dropped a bag of brushes into her tote, then clicked off the tripod light. “I’ve
            heard all about you, James. Including how old you are.”</p>
         <p>“Great. She’s been warned about you.” Caleb faced him. “I’m surprised you haven’t gotten
            fired yet.”</p>
         <p>James dug his smokes out of his backpack. Cierra didn’t know shit about him, and Cal,
            who knew everything about him, needed to chill. Cigarette between his lips, he spun the
            chair on its axis. After a couple lazy rotations, he stopped and leveled his gaze at
            Cierra.</p>
         <p>“So what do you think? Me and you…”</p>
         <p>Cierra lowered her bright pink tote to the floor and extended the handle. “Aren’t you
            dating Alexa Petrov?”</p>
         <p>“Dún do bheal.” Caleb pointed at James; his brows pulled into a stern blond line. “He’s
            kidding. Tell her you’re not serious—and not breaking the agency no dating rules.”</p>
         <p>James chuckled. Cal telling him to shut his mouth in Irish sounded as funny as Cierra’s
            use of the word dating, but he said what Caleb wanted. He always did.</p>
         <p>“Si. Mamar gallo. Of course, I’m not.”</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>“Is there anyone at the agency you haven’t slept with?” Caleb asked as soon as Cierra
            shut the door, “or in the city limits?”</p>
         <p>James shrugged. “I haven’t poked the blonde ride that moved next door.”</p>
         <p>He meant it as a joke. He caught Caleb spying on her as she unloaded boxes and hadn’t
            let him forget it.</p>
         <p>“She’s not a ride,” Caleb said with more conviction than a girl they hardly knew
            deserved. “I invited her over…to swim.”</p>
         <p>“You’ve talked to her?” There was no shock there. Caleb moved fast. But he hadn’t
            mentioned it and that was unusual. “When?”</p>
         <p>“It doesn’t matter. But I’ve been meaning to tell you, I plan on getting to know her;
            you know, do the girlfriend thing this summer. With a regular girl. One not in the
            scene. Also…I prefer she didn’t know about this.” He motioned to the vanity and rack of
            clothes in the otherwise barren loft. His gaze rested on James. “Any of this. When girls
            find out about modeling, they treat you differently. You’re in the same boat. Think
            about it.”</p>
         <p>Though it paid well, the sporadic jobs they went on hardly made them models, but James
            shook his head. Thinking was pointless and introspection was something he got plenty of,
            during therapy.</p>
         <p>He picked his cigarettes off the table and exchanged the smoke for a blunt. One quick
            hit was all he wanted. “You don’t think this girl will check you out? She knows your
            name. I guarantee she’s already scoped out your Instagram.”</p>
         <p>Caleb eyed the blunt but let it slide. “I edited my bio and removed any incriminating
            pictures. Besides, she lived in the country. In Kansas. How much can she know about
            fashion?”</p>
         <p>“You just called her daft cause she’s not from the city. Fine way to start a
            relationship.” Not that he cared how Cal maintained his girls, as long as they stayed
            out of the way.</p>
         <p>He licked the length of the blunt, the weight in his stomach lighter. If Cal’s issue was
            getting to know some random girl before screwing her, he’d wasted two weeks of vacation
            worrying for nothing. Caleb would never put a girl over him. Besides, from the glimpse
            he got of her, half-hidden behind boxes, she wasn’t even hot. As fair as Caleb, she
            resembled one of his many cousins, not a dating prospect.</p>
         <p>He shifted the blunt to the corner of his mouth. “When do I get to meet the girl that
            has you wanting to hide who you are—before you learn who she is?”</p>
         <p>“You’re on a need-to-know basis,” Caleb said, “you have a big mouth. You’d spoil it for
            me.”</p>
         <p>“I might.” James lit the blunt and inhaled deep. Smoke filled his lungs and would soon
            work its magic on his head. He offered up a hit.</p>
         <p>Caleb waved him off. “I’ll introduce you when she wants me so bad, she doesn’t know who
            she is.”</p>
         <p>“You mean when she wants you so bad, there’s no way she’d want me.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever.” Caleb frowned. “So, we’re good? You understand, right? I want a few solid
            weeks of alone time with this girl. Just me and her. Besides, didn’t Dr. Madison say you
            needed practice dealing with stuff, solo. Think you can survive summer without me
            keeping you alive?”</p>
         <p>James took another hit then licked his finger and extinguished the heater. In a couple
            days the girl would be forgotten, and he would have his friend back. When it came to
            Caleb, solo was not a word in their shared vocabulary.</p>
         <p>He smiled wide, all teeth. “Not a problem. I don’t need you.” </p>

         <h4>Chapter 2</h4>
         <p>Cassie lifted the heavy drapery from the corner of her second-floor bedroom window. Her
            new neighbor Caleb swam every morning, and his backstroke was the best reason to wake
            up—ever.</p>
         <p>Her father was right. A change of scenery might be good for her.</p>
         <p>Caleb disappeared behind the tall, wooden fence, concealing half the pool. He emerged
            seconds later, mid butterfly stroke. His arms sliced the water; powerful movements that
            showed off great form. He had to be on the swim team. The sport she excelled in before
            she dropped out of senior year mid-winter—and out of existence.</p>
         <p>Three weeks in her creepy new home and so far, the only friend she made was Allison, a
            girl she met in summer school. Not the successful starting over her father wished
            for.</p>
         <p>Caleb seems nice, her dad said, the third time Caleb stopped by to invite her to swim.
            Not all boys are like Paul.</p>
         <p>Then her dad’s new job started, and he left on a long-haul flight. The opportunity to
            fly an Airbus A380 was the official reason her father moved his family from Kansas—not
            just to get her out of the school district. Her mom, a flight attendant, would leave
            tomorrow.</p>
         <p>Her mom’s absence was never a bad thing, but it did mean she would be abandoned in the
            huge, old house—and being alone for days was well, lonely.</p>
         <p>Cassie let the curtain fall into place. So far, her journal entries read, Unpacking
            sucks… My new neighbor is cute… Yep, summer school… and… Help. I need a life. Outside of
            the skinny dipper she witnessed yesterday, a wild blur of dark hair and tattooed skin
            that sprang from Caleb’s tiny yellow guest house, her journal contained boring entries
            to reflect her empty world.</p>
         <p>She couldn’t tell if Caleb was trustworthy, but according to Instagram, he was a party
            boy with a huge following.</p>
         <p>A perfect contact for meeting people before school started.</p>
         <p>Her dad didn’t know the whole story—what happened with Paul was her fault and she
            deserved the fallout—but he did have something right. She needed to move past it, meet
            new people and get a life.</p>
         <p>She didn’t need her dad, his voice hushed, talking to her as if she were an injured
            animal. And she definitely didn’t need her mother. She needed a boyfriend, one she
            wanted to lose her virginity to. One who lived close by, available if she required
            him.</p>
         <p>Caleb would be perfect.</p>
         <p>A small cardboard box labeled Swim sat on the corner of her desk; the only box she
            hadn’t unpacked. She dumped its contents. Last summer’s pink bikini lay on top of her
            ragged collection of Blue Valley High’s black and gold swimsuits. The bikini fit better
            this year, snug where it should be, no gaps.</p>
         <p>She pulled on a worn pair of denim shorts, then tossed the team suits into the garbage.
            Goodbye, Blue Valley. Goodbye, Kansas. Goodbye, Paul.</p>
         <p>Hello new existence.</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>To avoid her mother, Cassie descended the narrow, rear stairway to the kitchen, then
            slipped into the backyard. She followed the fence until it ended, then padded across the
            strip of grass to Caleb’s garage. Their wooden gate banged shut behind her; loud enough
            to inform Caleb and half the neighborhood, of her arrival.</p>
         <p>The tight stone pathway, squeezed in between the fence and garage, ended in interlocking
            pavers fifteen-odd feet from the pool. There was no sign of Caleb, but the water’s cool
            blue ripples lured her forward.</p>
         <p>She maneuvered around a swing, between cushy lounge chairs and past potted ferns. The
            view from her window didn’t do his landscape justice. Across the narrow yard,
            sweet-scented, purple flowers hung from a vined pergola, and four colored Adirondack
            chairs surrounded a small firepit. The guest house that housed the streaker, looked cozy
            from the ground.</p>
         <p>She reached the pool, toes on the curved rim, and bent to test the water. Caleb broke
            through the surface at her feet.</p>
         <p>Gasping, she jumped back and clutched her chest.</p>
         <p>“Holy fuck!” Caleb’s eyes were wide. “You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing
            here?”</p>
         <p>“You said I should come swim… anytime… remember?” He sounded annoyed. Not at all like
            the friendly guy who invited her over.</p>
         <p>Brows furrowed, he glanced toward the yellow house, then sunk under the water. When he
            emerged, he smiled. “Sorry. I had a late night and a rough morning. Can we start
            over?”</p>
         <p>“Sure.” Her bikini strap slid off her shoulder as she lowered herself onto the pavers,
            but Caleb’s attention was once again on the small building in the rear of his yard. She
            eyed its lavender door as goosebumps pricked her arms. “Are we alone?”</p>
         <p>Caleb pulled himself out to sit beside her, his red spandex suit a second skin. “My
            friend likes to sleep in our pool house, but if we weren’t alone, we’d have company by
            now.” He flicked water at her. “I’m glad you came over. I thought I’d offended you
            somehow.”</p>
         <p>“I couldn’t resist the pool this morning.” What else could she say? It would help if he
            stopped staring at her. “Are your parents’ home?” Dang. That sounded like a proposition.
            She crossed her arms. “Does everyone around here fly. I mean work at
            Midway…Airport?”</p>
         <p>Caleb blinked, then stretched out, legs in the pool, elbows on the pavers. “My dad’s a
            pilot, but my family is involved with The University of Chicago. My mom quit teaching
            when…when I was ten.” He motioned to the top section of a brick house peeking over the
            tall pickets of the fence. “My friend Ron lives over there. Both his parents are
            lawyers. He's kind of an ass-hat, but he's here a lot.”</p>
         <p>“I saw him yesterday,” she admitted, “skinny dipping.”</p>
         <p>Caleb lurched upright, full attention on her. “I wouldn’t let Ron’s bare ass near my
            pool, especially if I was in it.”</p>
         <p>“I was in my bedroom and I…” She should have kept her mouth shut.</p>
         <p>He turned toward her house. “And your bedroom is?”</p>
         <p>“Over there.” She offered a weak gesture to the gabled, double set of windows she knew
            to be hers. “Second floor, far end. I can only see half your yard…not that I’m
            creeping.”</p>
         <p>“Wow,” he said after a few seconds. “We must have given old Mrs. Watkins quite a show
            when she lived in your house.”</p>
         <p>Cassie grinned. If old Mrs. Watkins got yesterday’s view, she would have had a heart
            attack. “If that wasn’t Ron, who was it?”</p>
         <p>“That would be James.” Creases appeared in Caleb’s forehead. “He used to live here.
            You'll meet him too. Eventually.”</p>
         <p>“It doesn’t sound like you like him much.”</p>
         <p>Caleb slid into the water and kicked off the side, seamlessly perfecting a dead man’s
            float. His hair, a blond halo, shimmered in the ripples. After a few seconds, he got his
            footing, sending droplets of water through the air.</p>
         <p>“I love the dude like a brother, but he has issues. I'm coming to get you.” He dove
            under, his body a shadow heading toward her. She yanked her feet out of the water just
            as he reached them.</p>
         <p>“You told me you could swim,” he said when he popped up. He grinned. “You're not afraid
            of me, are you?”</p>
         <p>She was. Residual fear leftover from Paul, but she would never admit it out loud, and
            planned to get over it. She stepped out of her shorts and headed past the low dive, to
            the high springboard.</p>
         <p>“Most private pools don’t have boards this high,” she said from the top.</p>
         <p>“My parents splurged. They insist if I practice enough, I’ll get a scholarship. But
            truthfully, I prefer swimming over diving.”</p>
         <p>She stopped mid-board. Diving in a bikini could be risky. Did she want to end up
            bottomless in his pool? She wanted to flirt, not look desperate.</p>
         <p>“You look pretty hot up there.” He waited alongside the edge. “Show me what you
            got.”</p>
         <p>She counted three steps, bounced once, and did a one and a half, forward flip, slicing
            the surface. Her execution wasn’t perfect, but good enough. She rose in the shallow end
            to applause.</p>
         <p>“The country girl has skills.”</p>
         <p>She could kill her mother for informing everybody they were from Kansas. “How come
            everyone in the city thinks you're a hick if you come from a small town?”</p>
         <p>“I don't think you're a hick.” Caleb disappeared under the water and closed the distance
            between them. He surfaced inches away. “In fact, I think my summer just got a lot more
            interesting.”</p>
         <p>“Because of me?” She could play this game.</p>
         <p>Droplets of water clumped his dark lashes and accented sky-blue eyes. Not a blemish or
            freckle marred his face. She was in over her head and half expected him to say just
            kidding.</p>
         <p>He tilted his head. “Do you have a boyfriend missing you like crazy back home?”</p>
         <p>“I didn’t date much.”</p>
         <p>“How come?”</p>
         <p>“Both my parents fly all the time. They stuck me with a nanny until my sixteenth
            birthday. I’ve never had a boyfriend that…” She bit her bottom lip. Information about
            Paul needed to stay buried. “What about you?”</p>
         <p>He climbed the steps and headed toward the pool house. “What do you want to know?”</p>
         <p>“Hmm. Let me think.” She followed but stopped short when they reached the entrance. Last
            time she was alone with a guy, she ended up in the hospital.</p>
         <p>Caleb waited in the open doorway. “I’m not an axe murderer. Leave the door open if you
            want.”</p>
         <p>With a deep breath, she crossed the threshold—and shut the door. Playing it safe ruined
            her life in Kansas. That wouldn’t happen again.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Make yourself at home.” Caleb paused in front of a wide archway that housed a tiny
            kitchenette. “I need a quick shower, or my hair will turn green. Give me two
            minutes.”</p>
         <p>Unable to sit in her wet swimsuit, she hovered by the door. The backside of a large TV
            blocked her view. After a minute, she inched around it.</p>
         <p>Mismatched chairs flanked an overstuffed sofa and surrounded a wooden coffee table,
            making the area cramped or cozy, depending on the company. The only other door, directly
            across from the bathroom, was partly open, a bedpost visible. Against the back wall, a
            collection of musical instruments surrounded an upright piano. She stepped closer to
            investigate. The bathroom door opened.</p>
         <p>Caleb cleared his throat. He’d changed into board shorts, a bright orange polo, and held
            two yellow towels. He draped one over his shoulders then handed her the other.</p>
         <p>“Come up with any questions?” he asked, as he plunked onto the sofa.</p>
         <p>After wrapping the towel around her hips, she sat on a chair. “Do you have a girlfriend
            who might be unhappy with me being here?” That would put a hitch in her plans.</p>
         <p>“I’m offended.” He laid his hand across his heart. “I wouldn't have invited you over if
            I did.”</p>
         <p>“But you’re cute. You must have girls all over you.”</p>
         <p>“Cute.” A rosy hue climbed his neck. “Like a puppy?”</p>
         <p>“Is there something wrong with that word?”</p>
         <p>He pulled one side of his mouth into a crooked smile. “I’m red, aren’t I? My friend
            would love to witness this.”</p>
         <p>“The ass-hat or the streaker?”</p>
         <p>His smile faded. “The streaker. Hey, I'm getting hungry. Why don't you go home and
            change? Let me take you out for lunch.”</p>
         <p>“Sure,” she said. This was easier than she thought. For the first time in a year, she
            relaxed.</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>The wooden screen door banged shut behind James as he entered Caleb’s kitchen. Wincing,
            he covered his ears. Last night had been a blast, at least what he could remember of it,
            but this morning was brutal.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s mom leaned against the counter as she rifled through a stack of index cards. She
            looked up, leaving him no choice but to stumble to the center island under her scrutiny.
            He sat on a stool and rested his forehead on the cool marble.</p>
         <p>“You look terrible,” she said, as her slippers appeared in his line of vision.</p>
         <p>He lifted his head.</p>
         <p>Before he could protest, she pressed her cool hand against his forehead. “You don’t feel
            hot.”</p>
         <p>He feigned a cough, hoping to appear sick, but being dishonest to Elizabeth sucked. Not
            having to lie to her was one of the reasons he moved into his own apartment.</p>
         <p>“Did Cal look sick this morning?” He lost track of Caleb sometime after midnight, but he
            couldn’t look much better. “Maybe we have the same thing.”</p>
         <p>The creases in Elizabeth’s forehead deepened, the same way Cal’s did when something
            upset him. “I worry about you, James.”</p>
         <p>Grateful as he was to Caleb’s mom for filling in where his own mother failed, he
            couldn’t do emotion with her. It seemed like a breach of loyalty, somehow. He focused on
            the fridge, but she stepped in front of him. A tactical move, that according to Dr.
            Madison, would force him to see her. Today it worked and he met her eyes.</p>
         <p>She rested her hand on his arm. “Stay healthy, please?”</p>
         <p>Not stiffening required energy he didn’t have. He hated hurting her, but his shoulders
            tensed.</p>
         <p>She retreated to the counter. “You just missed Cal.”</p>
         <p>“Missed him? Where did he go?”</p>
         <p>“Out with our new neighbor, Cassie. Lunch, I believe.”</p>
         <p>“Lunch? He took her on a date? In the daytime?” That seemed serious—and out of
            character. For the first time Caleb’s words about wanting a girlfriend pulled some
            weight.</p>
         <p>James yanked his phone from his back pocket. There were no messages from Caleb, asking
            if he got home safe. None.</p>
         <p>He scrolled to Caleb’s name. Enough shite, he typed, I want to meet up with you and
            Cassie.</p>
         <p>Screw his agreement to stay away.</p>
         <p>“Is something wrong?” Elizabeth asked from the end of the counter.</p>
         <p>“Cal left without checking on me.” Shit. Saying what he felt broke his standard
            practice. Especially when what he felt sounded pathetic. His brain must still be soaked
            in alcohol.</p>
         <p>A sad smile flickered across Elizabeth’s lips. “I'm sure he didn't forget about you.”
            She pushed a cup of coffee toward him. “I like Cassie. She seems more grounded than the
            girls you meet through modeling.”</p>
         <p>It was the standard lecture, and she’d given it multiple times, ever since they gave up
            high school girls. He sipped his coffee. At least she lost the poor baby expression.</p>
         <p>She set a small container of cream on the counter. “Sitting here in dirty pants and a
            wrinkly T-shirt, it’s hard to imagine you're the same person in those photos. Some of it
            is too risque. It reminds me of pornography.”</p>
         <p>Pornography. The word sounded extra dirty coming out of her mouth; and was off the table
            for morning conversation. Coffee splashed over the rim as he plunked his cup down.</p>
         <p>“Mom. Le do thoil.” The equivalent of, Mom, please.</p>
         <p>“You know I didn’t learn Irish like your brother did.” She poured a small amount of
            cream into her cup. “Why don't you go upstairs and take a hot bath? Go lay down in the
            guest room and...”</p>
         <p>The guest room had been his bedroom, but he never lasted an entire night in it. He ended
            up in Caleb’s room so often, Caleb’s father put a mattress on the floor. Cal never seem
            to mind the intrusion. They would spend hours talking, half English, half Irish, all
            nonsense. Not being alone at night was what he missed most when he moved.</p>
         <p>The muscles in his stomach clenched. There had been plenty of times he wished Cal would
            lighten up and get off his tail, but now that he had, the abandonment stung.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth stared at him from across the block. Had she said something else? Not cool.
            She was the last person he wanted to zone out in front of.</p>
         <p>“Jacuzzi… James...Why don’t you go soak in the tub then lay down for a while.” She
            retrieved his extra bottle of anti-anxiety meds from the cupboard above the sink and
            shook one into her palm. With an encouraging smile, she extended her hand. “Just take it
            and go clean up.”</p>
         <p>Unlike his real mother, Caleb’s mom proved trustworthy. He swallowed the pill with the
            rest of his coffee then reached for an apple from the fruit bowl. “Wake me up by noon,
            please.” He took a bite. “I have this casting thing. To walk in fall fashion week.”</p>
         <p>“Today?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah.” He stopped chewing. “What?”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth shook her head. “I realize the state views you as an adult, but if I had any
            say in it, I would insist you call in sick. This is exactly why I disagreed with your
            emancipation. Seventeen is too young to be on your own. You look terrible.”</p>
         <p>“Don’t worry.” He tried not to smile. “It's not my face they're interested in.”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth’s mouth dropped open.</p>
         <p>“I’m teasing,” he said. “Shit, Cal would kill me if I did that.”</p>
         <p>Not that it mattered. After sending that text, Caleb would kill him, anyway.</p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 3</h4>
         <p>Caleb inched backward on the chaise and pulled out his phone. There were other chairs
            under the pergola, but Cassie perched on the end of his, one heel propped on the floral
            cushion, so she could paint her toenails.</p>
         <p>He’d taken her to three movies, a bunch of restaurants and on a boat tour of the city.
            Somehow, he managed to evade James for the entire week, not an easy task at first. But
            by midweek James stopped trying to contact him. Now he couldn’t find the guy.</p>
         <p>He’d wanted space. He hadn’t wanted James to vanish.</p>
         <p>Angling his phone away from Cassie, he sent message number six into the James’ void. I
            need a response from you. Please.</p>
         <p>He sighed. At least his liver was getting a holiday—even though his conscience
            wasn’t.</p>
         <p>“Am I boring you?” Cassie stared toward her half-painted toes.</p>
         <p>She wasn’t. Compared to his time with James, hanging with Cassie relaxed him. Not
            wanting her to confuse boring with soothing, he shoved his phone into his pocket and
            leaned toward her. “You have a calming effect on me.”</p>
         <p>“Calm. That’s nice—I guess.” She finished her other foot in record time and wiggled her
            toes. “What do you think?”</p>
         <p>He studied her handiwork for a few seconds. The purple paint matched the fallen wisteria
            blooms. “I like the color. The jewel undertone compliments your skin tone.”</p>
         <p>Her focus shifted from the polish to him. “What do you know about skin tones? Sometimes
            I wonder about you, Caleb. You’re very private.” She pointed the paint applicator at
            him. “Let me guess. You have a foot fetish and are an expert at polishing women’s toes.
            Or maybe you polish your own?”</p>
         <p>“For the record, feet are gross.” </p>
         <p>“My feet aren’t gross.” She capped the polish. “But that’s an interesting fact about
            you. Tell me something else.”</p>
         <p>There was a restlessness about her he couldn’t put his finger on. It made him uneasy.
            “There’s nothing interesting about me.”</p>
         <p>“What about all those instruments in the pool house,” she said after a few seconds, “I
            counted seven. That’s unusual. Can you play them all?”</p>
         <p>There were eight if you counted James’ harmonica, stashed in the bedside table. And yes,
            he could play them all, but didn’t wish to spend the next hour proving he could, if
            that’s where this was headed. He smiled even though he wasn’t enjoying the third degree
            and was no longer relaxed. “I can play more than the guitar, and technically, they
            aren’t all mine.”</p>
         <p>Cassie humphed. “Oh yeah, I forgot about your imaginary friend, James.”</p>
         <p>It wasn’t the first time she dropped James’ name, and every time he brushed her off.
            “What do you want to do today?”</p>
         <p>Her jaw tightened, then relaxed. “Can we do something exciting?”</p>
         <p>“Exciting?” That was sort of insulting and—since he’d been enjoying their quiet
            evenings—not what he expected. “Like what?”</p>
         <p>She shifted onto her own chair and stared across the space at him. “Because you’re so
            secretive, I’m not going to tell you. Let’s see how well you know me. Guess.”</p>
         <p>With no idea, he shook his head. “I don’t understand girls at all.”</p>
         <p>“You’ve had like a zillion girlfriends. You must have women figured out by now.”</p>
         <p>Pure embellishment, but he grinned. “I thought I understood them, then I met you.”</p>
         <p>It was the truth. She didn’t drink or smoke, so he was careful not to talk about getting
            drunk or high. She seemed almost prudish, but he got the impression she found his
            attempts at getting to know her frustrating and would be more than willing to fall into
            his bed. The very thing he wanted to avoid.</p>
         <p>“You’re a mystery to me,” he said in earnest. Her cheeks turned an amazing shade of
            pink, a surprising turn on. He swung his leg over the chaise so he could lean closer,
            his fingertips edging the cuff of her shorts. “You’re not wowed by my good looks or
            amazing charm. It throws me off my game.”</p>
         <p>“I am wowed.” She patted his knee. “I just don't want to feed your ego.”</p>
         <p>The words to a great comeback all but materialized when the gate slammed shut. That had
            to be James, finally. But Ronnie emerged from behind the garage.</p>
         <p>Caleb sighed. Next time he saw James, he planned on strangling him.</p>
         <p>Ronnie left his flip flops by the pool and proceeded across the grass to sit on the end
            of Caleb’s newly empty chaise.</p>
         <p>“Ronnie, this is Cassie,” Caleb ran a quick introduction, “our new neighbor.”</p>
         <p>Ron issued an absentminded nod. “What the fuck did you do to James?”</p>
         <p>“You’ve seen him?” The news almost made Ron’s appearance worthwhile.</p>
         <p>“Sure did,” Ron said, “Last night. He’s pissed at you, man.”</p>
         <p>Caleb groaned. “I didn’t do anything to him.” Ignoring was the opposite of doing, wasn’t
            it? He gave Ron a poisonous glare intent on shutting him up.</p>
         <p>As usual, Ron missed the fine print. “That’s not what James said.”</p>
         <p>With no idea where this was headed, Caleb stood up. “Cassie, don’t you want to head
            out?” The sordid details of one of James’ escapades would likely scare the pants off
            her; and she didn’t need to discover he’d been ignoring his friend. He would text Ron
            for the details later.</p>
         <p>She shook her head. “I want to hear Ron’s story.”</p>
         <p>Ignoring Ron’s smug smile, Caleb flopped onto the cushion ready to do damage
            control.</p>
         <p>“I bumped into James last night, playing cards in Tyrone Yate’s basement. I asked him
            where you were and he said you were a, dirtbird, probably off chasin’ a new set of
            diddies.” Ronnie paused.</p>
         <p>It was a hilarious imitation of James, but Caleb refused to bite.</p>
         <p>“Go on,” Cassie inspected her nails then reopened the polish.</p>
         <p>Ron’s grin widened. “He accused two guys of cheating. Flipped a table over and
            everything.”</p>
         <p>“What happened to him?” Refusing to give Ron any satisfaction, Caleb kept his voice
            steady.</p>
         <p>“Nothing happened to him. He had to be pulled off the one dude.”</p>
         <p>Despite trying not to, Caleb grinned. James won more battles than he lost.</p>
         <p>Ron’s smile faded. “What are you grinning like a jackass for? Didn’t you hear me? He’s
            pissed at you. I wouldn't want him pissed at me.”</p>
         <p>“That’s why you came over? To warn me?” Caleb laughed. “I already knew James was mad at
            me. He'll get over it.”</p>
         <p>“So, you did do something to him?” Ron’s frown twisted into a smirk, one that said
            ‘ah-ha, got you’.</p>
         <p>Caleb glanced at Cassie. Her bright-eyed interest bugged him as much as Ron’s
            attitude.</p>
         <p>She blew on her newly painted fingers. “When am I going to meet this guy?”</p>
         <p>“She hasn’t met James?” Ronnie’s gaze flicked to Cassie, then back to Caleb. He shook
            his head. “Never mind. What's going on today?”</p>
         <p>Lost, Caleb looked to Cassie for direction.</p>
         <p>“Shopping. Caleb’s taking me to the Woodfield Mall.” She beamed.</p>
         <p>A trip to the mall wouldn’t be a problem, except Woodfield housed his headless, Yolo
            photo. He busted his ass last summer working in their store to secure that print, while
            James lasted less than two weeks as a greeter, folding shirts—yet got invited to the
            same shoot.</p>
         <p>He gave Cassie the thumbs up. “What are you shopping for?” Since his face wasn't in the
            photo, she’d never recognize him, but with any luck she’d hate that brand.</p>
         <p>“Stuff to go out in. Someplace different.”</p>
         <p>“Different?” Where could she possibly want to go, that he hadn’t taken her? He lifted
            his hands. “I’m out of entertainment ideas.”</p>
         <p>“My friend from summer school keeps talking about parties. Do you know anything about
            that stuff?”</p>
         <p>Ron stifled a laugh.</p>
         <p>“I do,” Caleb replied warily, her request eerily similar to the slew of girls he’d hung
            with who wanted him for the clubs he could get them into. “But I’ve been enjoying your
            company solo. Maybe I'm not ready to share you yet.”</p>
         <p>“Maybe I'm ready to be shared.”</p>
         <p>“Ouch.” Ronnie chuckled as he stared across the yard.</p>
         <p>Caleb opened his mouth and shut it. A lot of girls would have loved to have his
            undivided attention for one day, let alone seven. Yet here she was, needing more, while
            he did cartwheels trying to please her. Dating exhausted him.</p>
         <p>Ron cleared his throat. “Who are you hanging with at summer school?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah. Who is telling you about parties?” He hadn’t given her an official you’re my
            girlfriend talk, and they hadn’t moved past kissing, but he’d put in enough effort to
            consider them together.</p>
         <p>“My friend Allison.”</p>
         <p>“What’s her last name?” He dated an Allison freshman year.</p>
         <p>“Ziegler.”</p>
         <p>“Allison Ziegler?” Ron’s wide eyes betrayed Caleb.</p>
         <p>Cassie tapped a finger to her forehead. “Let me guess. Considering Ron’s response, I
            assume she’s an ex.”</p>
         <p>“Yes.” Lying would be pointless with Ron there. “But I haven't talked to her since ninth
            grade.” It was close enough to the truth. “Did you mention me?”</p>
         <p>“Not by your full name. But I will now. Unless you don’t want me to.”</p>
         <p>“I don’t care.” What else could he say?</p>
         <p>His mom appeared in the back doorway, one of her frilly aprons around her waist. “I made
            sandwiches. Enough for you too, Ron.”</p>
         <p>“No thanks, Mrs. P.” Ronnie stepped into his flip-flops. “As entertaining as this is,
            I’ve got to bolt. Have fun at the mall, Callie.”</p>
         <p>“Don’t fucking call me that, Ronald.” Caleb flipped Ron the finger, but he’d already
            rounded the garage.</p>
         <p>“Caleb. Be nice.” His mom planted her hands on her hips. “James calls you Callie all the
            time.”</p>
         <p>And since James made the nickname up, he, and only he, could use it. He waved at his
            mother. “We’ll be right in.”</p>
         <p>“Your mom is so nice.” Cassie wandered to the pool. She sat cross-legged on the edge and
            stirred the water with her fingers. “You don’t have to take me shopping. You’ve been
            preoccupied most of today. If you want me to go home, I can.”</p>
         <p>Preoccupied. Great. Why was it so difficult to have something for himself? All he asked
            for was time alone to get to know a girl. A girl that actually liked him, not one who
            followed him around like a puppy.</p>
         <p>He joined Cassie. Now that he knew James was breathing, one more evening of freedom
            couldn’t hurt.</p>
         <p>“Look.” He set his phone to, do not disturb. “I’m all yours.” </p>

         <h4>Chapter 4</h4>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>Caleb curled around Cassie on the pool house sofa; his chin nuzzled against the top of
            her head. The shopping trip went off without a hitch. They ate supper out, then settled
            down to watch TV Land’s Fantasy Island marathon. It may not have been exciting, but with
            short notice, it was the best he could do. Besides, Cassie had never seen the show, or
            any of the retro series he loved.</p>
         <p>The shrill ring from the cordless phone on the end table jarred Caleb from his TV coma.
            He stretched to answer it, expecting his mother who used the landline like an
            intercom.</p>
         <p>James’ number lit the screen instead.</p>
         <p>He scrambled over Cassie. Since he didn’t want his first words to be, “Where the hell
            are you?” he took a relaxing breath. “What’s up?”</p>
         <p>“Is this Cal?” The voice on the other end was unsure, and female.</p>
         <p>Not used to strangers calling him Cal, or girls on the other end of James’ line, he
            paused.</p>
         <p>“James told me to call you if needed,” the girl said, “but your other number went right
            to voicemail.”</p>
         <p>Damn. To appease Cassie, he hadn’t touched his phone all evening. He glanced at her,
            still absorbed in Fantasy Island, unaware the quiet evening just blew up.</p>
         <p>“Who are you?” he asked, stepping away from the sofa.</p>
         <p>“I'm his sitter.”</p>
         <p>“Sitter?” Caleb wet his lips. “Where’s James? Why didn’t he call me himself?”</p>
         <p>The girl huffed, “Never mind. You're freaking. I’ll take care of it myself.”</p>
         <p>“No... I'm not freaking out.” He tightened his grip on the slick plastic receiver. “I'm
            trying to figure out what's going on.”</p>
         <p>“Who is that?” Cassie mouthed.</p>
         <p>He motioned to give him a moment, then cranked the volume on the TV. He stalked into the
            kitchen. “Is James okay?”</p>
         <p>“I think so.” The girl sounded unsure. “He's breathing, but he hit his head. I’d let him
            lie there, but my boyfriend called. He’s on his way home and James has to be gone.”</p>
         <p>It wasn’t a good visual. He wanted to reach through the phone and shake her. “Where are
            you?”</p>
         <p>“5950 South Wells. It's in Fuller Park. The quickest way is to drop down to 47th.”</p>
         <p>Caleb yanked his cell from his pocket. “Typing the address in now.” The map showed him
            the same way. “You know where I live?”</p>
         <p>“Just hurry up.”</p>
         <p>“I will.” He headed to the sofa. “Give me ten minutes.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“I have to go,” he said as he slipped into his shoes. Cassie gaped at him, but he had no
            intention of offering an explanation. He circled the room. “Where are my damn keys?”</p>
         <p>“Calm down.” She located the keys from beside the TV then pressed them into his palm.
            “Is everything okay?”</p>
         <p>Nothing was okay. He should never have brushed James off. His mother would kill him if
            something bad happened—and he would never forgive himself.</p>
         <p>He headed for the door. “I need to go help a friend.”</p>
         <p>“I got that. Can I come?”</p>
         <p>“Nope.” Images of getting shot at by some gang banger floated through his head. It would
            be impossible to watch out for her and James at the same time. “It might get dicey. You
            should go home.”</p>
         <p>“Sounds intriguing.” She snatched her purse and followed him across the grass, to the
            garage. “You might need me. I'll be good.” She crossed her fingers over her heart.</p>
         <p>Dragging her into a James situation would irrevocably change the solitude he’d been
            enjoying. But her eyes were bright. She seemed excited by the possibility of danger.
            Their earlier conversation floated back to him. She craved excitement while he wanted
            peace. It was like they were on two different tracks heading in opposite directions.</p>
         <p>She opened the passenger door and smiled over the car. “Come on, Caleb. Let me help
            you.”</p>
         <p>“Get in,” he said. There was no time to waste.</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>“Is it possible to get anywhere in Chicago in ten minutes?” Cassie asked over the bass
            line pounding from his car speakers. She clung to the door as they squealed around the
            first corner, but he had no intention of slowing down. “Whose car is this? It looks like
            the one on Dukes of Hazzard.”</p>
         <p>“I'm impressed.” He flashed her a wide smile, happy for the distraction. “It’s
            mine.”</p>
         <p>“You own a car? Why do we walk so much?”</p>
         <p>“Walking's the best way to learn a city.” He turned the radio down. “I might need you to
            drive James’ car home. It’s a stick.”</p>
         <p>“I can drive a stick,” she said, proudly, “I’ve driven the tractor on my grandpa’s farm.
            Told you I’d be helpful.”</p>
         <p>“Look, Cassie.” What did he want to convey? “You seem excited by all this and James is
            my best friend—but he's messed up.”</p>
         <p>“Messed up how?”</p>
         <p>No longer able to avoid the topic, he sighed. “Without getting into it, his parents were
            wackjobs. He got a ton of cash from them, along with a scrambled head. He lived with us
            because the state placed him there.”</p>
         <p>“That’s how you met?”</p>
         <p>“We met at the University of Chicago. We were part of this long-term study my mom helped
            run.” He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. “We learned musical selections
            followed by several types of math tests. I’ve known James since I was six. Take it from
            me, he’s all over the place—and can find trouble.</p>
         <p>“Wow.” Cassie stared at him.</p>
         <p>It was an impressed sounding wow, the opposite of what he wanted.</p>
         <p>“Wow, what?” He clicked the radio off and waited.</p>
         <p>“You guys must be smart—and James sounds intriguing.”</p>
         <p>Intriguing? He gave her a sideways look, trying to get a handle on her expression.
            “There is nothing Intriguing or even interesting about him. Keep your distance,
            okay?”</p>
         <p>“Okay.” She chuckled.</p>
         <p>“Seriously.” Caleb poked her shoulder. “He's unpredictable—and charming. It's a deadly
            combination.”</p>
         <p>She poked him back. “It sounds like you're scared I'll run away with him. Did he steal
            one of your many girlfriends?”</p>
         <p>That was the funniest thing she’d said. “Believe me, he doesn’t need my girls.”</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>Cassie released a relieved sigh when they rounded the corner onto Wells. They made it in
            under fifteen minutes.</p>
         <p>“What was the address?” she asked, not that it mattered. Not all the buildings had
            numbers—or windows. They passed one without a front door.</p>
         <p>“5950.” Caleb slowed the Charger. “There it is.”</p>
         <p>He parked in front of a vintage, black Mustang that blended into the night. If that was
            James’ car, the ride back would be fun.</p>
         <p>A squat, one-story brick building sat back from the curb, a blanket draped its front
            window. This is how she imagined the South Side. This was exciting.</p>
         <p>Caleb banged on the solid, metal door. She peeked over his shoulder as the door inched
            open.</p>
         <p>A skinny young woman appeared in the gap. She pushed stringy black bangs away from her
            eyes and gave them a scrutinizing once over. “Are you Cal?”</p>
         <p>“Caleb,” he corrected, his shoulder against the door, like he planned to barrel through
            if needed. “Where’s James? And who are you?”</p>
         <p>“He’s still out of it.” She moved to let them pass into a messy, living room. “I told
            you, I’m his sitter. You can call me T. That’s all you need to know.”</p>
         <p>“I don't get it,” Cassie whispered when the girl turned to secure three huge locks, “who
            is she?”</p>
         <p>Caleb shifted his gaze to the floor. “A sitter watches you when you get high to make
            sure you don't hurt yourself.”</p>
         <p>“She didn't do a very good job,” Cassie said loud enough for T to hear.</p>
         <p>“He’s in the bedroom,” the girl said as she passed them. Her gaze brushed over Cassie,
            “Something freaked him out; he jumped off the sofa and took off running. Just get him
            and go.”</p>
         <p>The back room contained no bed—or anything that made it worthy of the title, bedroom,
            and smelled like a bathroom. Cassie stopped in the middle of the scattered cardboard
            boxes and discarded piles of clothes and waited for her eyes to adjust to the low watt
            bulb dangling from the ceiling. It took a few seconds to locate James, face down on the
            cracked linoleum.</p>
         <p>“Damn it.” Caleb rushed forward. “Is there another light in here?”</p>
         <p>T fumbled with a floor lamp and all three of its arms clicked on. She adjusted one of
            the arms and a bright circle of light crept across the floor, illuminating the
            situation.</p>
         <p>So, this was the mystical James. The streaker. His unbuttoned shirt fanned out on either
            side of him, the tips of his dark hair tucked under the collar. One of the sleeves was
            cuffed and his tattooed forearm twisted at an uncomfortable angle from his body. Blood
            splattered the dirty white paint of the open closet door.</p>
         <p>More curious than scared, Cassie inched forward. She sidestepped a pool of liquid and
            knelt as Caleb carefully rolled James over.</p>
         <p>James’ bangs, the ends matted, tumbled off his face. A gash across his forehead had bled
            out and gaped open. His top lip was split and swollen. The front of his jeans, soaked
            with urine, explained the puddle on the floor and the smell in the room.</p>
         <p>Caleb drew a long breath, his face white. “Jesus.”</p>
         <p>Cassie also took a breath. James’ long lashes curled in an enviable manor, his cheek
            bones prominent, his jaw strong. Even in his current state, James was beautiful. And
            like a broken china doll, his ruin pulled at her heart in the same manner. It seemed
            intrusive to witness such vulnerability in a stranger. She looked across to Caleb.</p>
         <p>His eyes flicked to her, as if to catch her reaction, then he lit into T. “What the fuck
            did he take?”</p>
         <p>“Magic mint,” T said from the shadows outside the ring of light. “At least that's all I
            know about. He was boozed up when he got here.”</p>
         <p>“He drove here? Drunk?” The muscle in Caleb’s jaw flexed.</p>
         <p>T nodded. “He brought a bag of the stuff and insisted on trying it. He asked if I would
            watch him—and just so you know, I tried to talk him out of it.”</p>
         <p>Cassie looked at T, the ground, the walls, and the piles of laundry. Anywhere but the
            body between her and Caleb. Finally, her eyes rested on the interwoven symbol inked on
            the top of James’ left hand, the words Tus Nua printed underneath. His fingers were
            long; the nails appeared manicured. The letters, T.A.K.E were scrolled above his
            knuckles. The gold band of an aquamarine ring obscured the top of the A</p>
         <p>Her gaze jumped to his stomach, stretched flat between his hip bones. The inked letter I
            sat at the top of a curved design; the rest of the image remained hidden beneath his
            pants. She tilted her head, to try to view the narrow gap between the button of his
            jeans and his skin. The shiver that played between her shoulder blades, shot down her
            spine.</p>
         <p>“I can't believe Salvia did this.” Caleb regained some color. He pushed up James’
            shirtsleeve and inspected the skin. “Cassie, check his other arm.”</p>
         <p>James’ hand twitched, warm against her palm. The underside of his wrist housed a skull
            tattoo. A cross and more foreign words covered his forearm. The ink made it difficult to
            see anything, and with no experience in the body checking category, she was lost. “What
            am I looking for?”</p>
         <p>“Needle marks,” T answered.</p>
         <p>Stirring, James’ eyes flickered open, a circle of sea green ringed his dilated pupils.
            He pulled his arm from Caleb’s grasp. “No needles, Callie.”</p>
         <p>James’ gaze caught hers and held. She inhaled so sharply Caleb jerked his head up. At
            that moment, she didn’t care. Everything but James faded into obscurity.</p>
         <p>He blinked up at her. “Are you my angel?”</p>
         <p>She dropped his hand.</p>
         <p>Caleb sat back on his heels and looked toward T. “God, he's still tripping. Do you have
            his keys?”</p>
         <p>“He didn't give them to me.”</p>
         <p>Groaning, Caleb patted James’ wet, front pockets.</p>
         <p>“Screw off.” James pushed the intrusion away.</p>
         <p>Caleb easily caught James’ wrist. He pinned it under his knee, then reached into the
            left pocket. His disgusted expression relieved the tightness coiled inside her and she
            chuckled.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s scowl deepened. “What are you laughing at? You’re his angel. You should do
            this.” He pulled out a keyring and wiped them on his shorts before tossing them into her
            lap. “You’re driving, remember. That was his Mustang I parked in front of. Help me get
            him on his feet.”</p>
         <p>Obeying, she looped her arm around James’ middle where it rested against the warmth of
            his lower back. An unfamiliar bubble tickled her insides.</p>
         <p>T followed them to the front door.</p>
         <p>Caleb held out his hand. “Where's his phone?”</p>
         <p>She retrieved an iPhone from the cluttered coffee table and dropped it into Caleb’s
            palm.</p>
         <p>“Anything else?” Caleb said, “if he can't find his wallet tomorrow, I'm coming
            back.”</p>
         <p>T unlocked the door and yanked it open. “You have it all.”</p>
         <p>Caleb carried most of James weight as he maneuvered through the doorway. “Thanks for
            calling.”</p>
         <p>“Not a problem.” T slammed the door, leaving them on the tiny cement landing.</p>
         <p>James' body tensed against Cassie’s side.</p>
         <p>“Callie?” he blurted out like a frightened child. “Ta' slaghda'n orm!” The words were
            slurred and not English.</p>
         <p>“We're almost to the car.” Caleb quickened his pace and she struggled to keep up.</p>
         <p>They made the street, but James stopped short. “I'm gonna boke.” He gagged.</p>
         <p>Cassie didn’t need experience to recognize that sound. She jumped off the curb. James
            heaved once, nothing but liquid, and Caleb shouldered him the remaining few steps toward
            the car.</p>
         <p>“It’s okay.” He braced James’ hands against the hood. “You'll be home in a bit.”</p>
         <p>“Maybe you should call an ambulance,” Cassie suggested.</p>
         <p>Caleb gave her an incredulous look and she kicked at the broken asphalt under her
            sandals. “How often do you do this?”</p>
         <p>“Go scumming? Me, never.” He kept his focus on James. “Usually, our nights are a bit
            more upscale and sometimes it's me that needs to be brought home. But it's alcohol I'm
            sick on, no drugs. Well, maybe a little weed. But nothing stronger.”</p>
         <p>“How come he didn't get you to be his sitter?” It made more sense to her.</p>
         <p>“Because he knows I would never let him do this,” he waved both arms at James, “to
            himself. Booze is one thing but look at him.”</p>
         <p>James’ breathing regulated, but his arms vibrated. His eyes skated over her, to Caleb.
            “How did I get here?”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s posture tensed. “You don’t remember coming here? At all? Tell me this wasn’t an
            episode.”</p>
         <p>“Scith a ligean, Arsehole.” James’ gaze caught hers.</p>
         <p>Caleb glanced at her as well. “Screw off, James,” he said, “I am relaxed.”</p>
         <p>He helped James into the back seat then leaned in to click the seatbelt. After shutting
            the door, he faced her. “Follow me. And don't worry; I plan on going slow.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie had no problem shadowing the bright orange Charger. She parked behind them on the
            concrete driveway. “Should I leave his car here?”</p>
         <p>Caleb nodded. He opened the Charger’s door and adjusted the driver’s seat forward, as
            far as it could go. James had piled up in the back. He jumped when Caleb reached for
            him.</p>
         <p>“It’s me.” Caleb reached in again. “You’re good.”</p>
         <p>He propped James against the car where he promptly slid into a squat. A groan floated up
            from under his hair.</p>
         <p>“Stay with him.” Caleb threw her an apologetic smile. “I’m going into the house for the
            first aid kit. I’ll be right back.”</p>
         <p>James swiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then peered up at her through his
            bangs. He smiled. “My angel still here.”</p>
         <p>He sounded more lucid, but she couldn’t narrow down his garbled accent other than
            somewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
         <p>Bit by bit, he inched his way up the car then lounged against it, as if they were
            hanging out on a normal night. It might have been more believable if his attire wasn’t a
            complete disaster. Despite the situation, his expression remained confident.</p>
         <p>“Hi. I’m James.” He looked downward, at himself, then back to her. His smile widened.
            “My greatest apologies for being such a mess.”</p>
         <p>A dab of blood formed on his split lip, which he licked.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s warning flashed through her brain. James was unpredictable and charming—a hot
            mess. What kind of person would do this to themselves? He pushed himself off the car and
            headed through the gate into the backyard, towards the pool house.</p>
         <p>Since she was supposed to keep an eye on him, she followed.</p>
         <p>The screen door in the main house slammed shut and Caleb came up behind them. “Whoa. I
            told you to wait for me.”</p>
         <p>James opened the pool house door. “Is gá dom a bhaint as an seomra folctha.” He stepped
            into the bright room.</p>
         <p>A blast of frigid air hit Cassie as she followed.</p>
         <p>Caleb scooted past her. “Ta tu ro-dheanach, dude,”</p>
         <p>Unsure what to do, she lounged cross armed against the wall. “What did he say?”</p>
         <p>“That he needs to use the bathroom.” Caleb shook his head. “I told him it was too
            late.”</p>
         <p>James glared at Caleb. “Póg mo thóin, Cal.” Jutting his chin toward her, he added, “You
            can kiss my ass too, Luv, if you like.”</p>
         <p>“Rude,” she said, but bit back a smile.</p>
         <p>James hit the light switch, leaving them in the glow of the television. He stumbled
            across the room, toward the bedroom.</p>
         <p>“Wait.” Caleb flicked the light on. “You’re not crashing. I need to check out that cut
            and your clothes are… gross.”</p>
         <p>“I planned on stripping, Mam.” James let his shirt slide off his shoulders and undid his
            jeans.</p>
         <p>“James.” Caleb pointed to her, still by the door. “We have company.”</p>
         <p>She waved.</p>
         <p>Caleb pulled one of the chairs away from the tiny bistro table. “Come over here.” He
            patted the wood. “Sit. Please.”</p>
         <p>With an unhappy grunt, James sat. His eyes found hers and stuck. If he thought she would
            rescue him, he was mistaken.</p>
         <p>“Cassie.” Caleb opened the first aid kit then lit the flashlight on his phone. “Can you
            please go soak a cloth in hot water?”</p>
         <p>When she headed toward the kitchen sink, he added, “in the bathroom.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A neat stack of folded face cloths occupied a basket on the bathroom counter. Cassie
            selected one and held it under the hot water. After a minute, she wrung it out then shut
            the water off. A hushed conversation floated from the next room.</p>
         <p>“Damn it.” There was a hint of pleading in Caleb’s voice. “I know you have a death wish
            but think about Mom. Think about me.”</p>
         <p>“You?” said James, “I haven't seen you since that Soith moved next door.”</p>
         <p>She gasped. Whatever a soith was, it didn’t sound pleasant. James hated her, and didn’t
            even know her.</p>
         <p>“That’s what this is all about?” Caleb was no longer whispering. “You’re jealous? Don't
            you realize what it does to me to have to pick you up like that? Covered in blood and
            piss. Fuck. Slow down. I can't keep up.”</p>
         <p>“Don’t try, then.” James coughed. “Stop fussing over me. Go play with your
            girlfriend.”</p>
         <p>Cassie heard enough. They quieted as she entered the room. “How’s the patient?” she
            asked, handing over the face cloth.</p>
         <p>“Crashing.” Caleb scowled. “And in a foul mood.” He pressed the cloth against James’
            forehead.</p>
         <p>Water trickled down James’ cheeks and he shirked away. “I want her to do it.”</p>
         <p>“Fuck off, James.” Caleb hovered the cloth over the wound. “Stay still.”</p>
         <p>James knocked Caleb’s hand away. He glowered at Cassie. “Hurry up. I already told you, I
            need to piss, and go to bed. Preferably in that order.”</p>
         <p>“Damn it.” Caleb shoved the cloth at her. “Do you mind? There’s no point arguing with
            him. He won't remember anything in the morning.”</p>
         <p>“Come on, angel.” James smirked. “I won't bite…unless you want me to.”</p>
         <p>Caleb sighed. “Stop being such an ass. Tip your head back and shut up.”</p>
         <p>The cloth felt foreign in Cassie’s grip, the role of caretaker unfamiliar. Nobody needed
            her. Ever. She pushed James’ hair back, then pressed the material against his cut. The
            muscle in his jaw clenched. He placed his hand over hers.</p>
         <p>“You’re done.” Caleb removed James’ hand. “You'll have to make do with me. Your angel is
            leaving.”</p>
         <p>James kept his gaze on her but remained cooperative as Caleb finished cleaning the area,
            applied first aid cream, then slapped on a couple of butterfly bandages.</p>
         <p>“Do you need help to the bathroom?” Caleb asked.</p>
         <p>“Feck off, Cal.” The chair teetered, as James got to his feet. He raised an eyebrow at
            Cassie, then staggered to the sofa where he fell face-first onto the cushions.</p>
         <p>It took Cassie a few seconds to notice Caleb held the door open.</p>
         <p>“That was awkward,” she offered as she stepped into the night. “And just so you know, he
            forgot to pee.”</p>
         <p>Caleb took her hand and hurried her through the gate. “He'll probably get up in the
            middle of the night and break his nose on the bathroom sink. But hell, I tried.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>They reached her front door. Dark windows informed her; her mother was in bed.</p>
         <p>“Thanks for being there for me tonight,” Caleb said, as she dug her key out of her
            purse, “James is a train wreck, but I'm all he has.”</p>
         <p> “You said his parents were wack jobs. What happened to them?”</p>
         <p>“His stepdads in Statesville prison, an hour’s drive from here.” Caleb glanced down.
            “Hopefully, his mothers in hell. She hung herself about a year and a half ago. James got
            all her cash—and she had a lot of it.” He met her eyes. “Don't let on you know any of
            this.”</p>
         <p>“That’s horrible.” James’ issues were more serious than she’d imagined. “If I ever see
            him again, my lips are sealed.</p>
         <p>He kissed her forehead. “About that. I haven’t spent much time with him lately—and need
            to keep him close. What I’m saying is, James is going to hang with us more often.”</p>
         <p>A tiny pulse of adrenaline flitted through Cassie’s body. Small enough to ignore. She
            smiled. “I promise I won't run away with him.”</p>
         <p>It was a joke, but Caleb’s expression remained blank.</p>
         <p>She stuck the key in the lock. “I thought you didn't want me around him.”</p>
         <p>“I also don't want to attend his funeral.” Caleb backed off the steps. “Sorry our
            evening ended so crazy.”</p>
         <p>It had been crazy, but also exhilarating, and a far cry from her evenings in Kansas. She
            would have told him it was fine, but he disappeared through the gate before she could
            reply.</p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 5</h4>
         <p>For the first time since Cassie moved in, Caleb skipped his morning workout. She pulled
            on her robe and headed downstairs. An empty wine bottle sat on the kitchen table. Two
            twenties stuck out from underneath, along with a folded paper.</p>
         <p>Flying standby to meet your dad. Be back in a few days. Mom.</p>
         <p>Cassie tossed the note into the garbage, then dialed Caleb. Her call went straight to
            voicemail.</p>
         <p>By noon, she had called Caleb five times.</p>
         <p>For supper, she boiled Ramen noodles but couldn’t choke them down. Pacing the kitchen,
            she tried Caleb again. This time she left a message.</p>
         <p>Call me. Please. He’d get back to her now.</p>
         <p>**</p>
         <p>Laughter from the pool reached her bedroom window. Groaning, Cassie rolled over. It
            couldn’t possibly be morning, but daylight said otherwise. At least Caleb was outside.
            Two days minus his swim routine would feel like an alternate universe. She headed to the
            window.</p>
         <p>James sat beside the pool eating a banana, while Caleb drifted close by on an inflatable
            lounger. He sipped a drink—like he hadn't a care in the world.</p>
         <p>She snatched her phone from her tangled sheets and dialed his number. She couldn’t hear
            his phone ring, but Caleb’s head jerked toward the tiny poolside table. He motioned to
            her house, bringing James’ gaze to her window.</p>
         <p>She stepped back, but what the heck? He ignored her call. Screw him—and his crazy
            friend. They could have each other.</p>
         <p>The day dragged. By evening, claps of thunder had her jumping out of her skin and
            lightning split a rainless sky. After checking all the locks, she headed upstairs.</p>
         <p>Though she kept the curtains open, her room seemed extra dark. Last night’s dream
            floated back. She had fallen into a pit and no matter how loud she yelled, no one came.
            Despite the humidity, she pulled the sheet to her chin.</p>
         <p>The clock on her dresser glowed twelve-thirty; ten minutes since she last checked. Every
            second of solitude seemed like an eternity. She got out of bed. Anything would be better
            than lying there.</p>
         <p>Warm light shone from the pool house like a welcoming beacon. What would Caleb do if she
            banged on his door and asked why he ignored her? Showing up in her semi-sheer cami and
            pajama shorts might loosen his tongue.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The moonless sky made the night blacker than usual. She slipped through the gate into
            Caleb’s backyard and skittered barefoot past the pool, the water dark and bottomless in
            the night air. Something rustled under the wisteria vine. A wave of panic sent her
            through the unlocked door without knocking.</p>
         <p>She stopped short. James sat, relaxed against the sofa cushions, bathed in the soft
            light of the muted television. His eyes were closed. Naked, except for white boxer
            briefs, his bare legs sprawled across the coffee table. A guitar rested on the cushion
            beside him, and music emanated from the Bose speaker next to his feet.</p>
         <p>Despite her lack of attire, the air-conditioned room became hot. Fueled by the rush of
            being where she shouldn’t, she stepped around the TV. A thick inked band circled James’
            left ankle. Letters twisted up his right thigh. His briefs rode low enough to read the
            word Unity, but the picture it curved around remained hidden.</p>
         <p>“And you are?”</p>
         <p>She jerked her head up. His eyes were locked on her, one eyebrow raised. Confusion
            flicked across his features.</p>
         <p>Caleb was right. James had no memory of her.</p>
         <p>“Can you speak?” Both brows were now raised, and a smile played on his lips. He made no
            effort to cover up.</p>
         <p>“You’re not dressed,” was all she could come up with.</p>
         <p>“You’re in my bedroom.” He rested his hands on his thighs. “Good thing I didn't fall
            asleep naked with my wank in my hand. Who did you say you were again?”</p>
         <p>“Cassie. I live next door.” She pointed in the direction of her house.</p>
         <p>“Ah.” His jaw tightened; all signs of humor gone. “You must be looking for my brother.
            Funny, he’s never mentioned you.” His gaze flicked to her chest. “But I'm sure he'll be
            sorry he missed this.”</p>
         <p>What a liar. James may not remember the other night, but Caleb must have mentioned her.
            He looked right at her bedroom window this morning.</p>
         <p>She crossed her arms. “Brother?” She may not know much about his and Caleb’s
            relationship, but she knew they weren’t related.</p>
         <p>He snorted but his dismissive expression wavered. “He didn’t tell you he had a
            brother?”</p>
         <p>She shook her head.</p>
         <p>“It’s late.” He toward the clock. “Cal’s not here so you can go home.”</p>
         <p>Home was the last place she wanted to go, and here was the last place she should be, but
            she couldn’t make her feet move. At least in the pool house she wasn’t alone.</p>
         <p>James scratched his chin. “Why did you come here? It's the middle of the night yet you
            show up—wearing that.”</p>
         <p>Her reasoning made more sense from her bedroom.</p>
         <p> “Hello?” He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “I’m waiting.”</p>
         <p>“I had a bad dream,” she said.</p>
         <p>“Why isn’t more clothing involved if all you want is comfort?”</p>
         <p>Her cheeks heated, but it was hard to act indignant in her current attire. “Caleb hasn't
            been answering my calls. I wanted to talk to him to see why.”</p>
         <p>“And you figure showing up here wearing skimpy pajamas will make it harder for him to
            throw you out on your ass.”</p>
         <p>It was exactly what she figured but sounded ridiculous coming out of his mouth.</p>
         <p>James scooped his phone from the coffee table. He turned the music down and relaxed
            against the sofa, arms behind his head. “So…Caleb hasn't talked to you for a couple of
            days. I can't imagine why.”</p>
         <p>His smug smile said he knew why—but didn’t plan on telling. Tears filled her eyes.
            They'd probably spent the last two days making fun of her.</p>
         <p>His smile evaporated. He ran his hand through his hair then, with a sigh, retrieved a
            pair of jeans from the floor and stepped into them. Leaving them undone, he headed to
            the kitchen.</p>
         <p>“I can feel your eyes drilling holes in my back,” he said, as he faced her. “You’re
            making my head throb.”</p>
         <p>“I’m giving you a headache?” He couldn’t be serious.</p>
         <p>“Do you know what the term ‘being eye-fucked’ means, and how it might apply in this
            situation?” He motioned between them.</p>
         <p>Of course, she knew what it meant, but blinked at him, speechless.</p>
         <p>“Forget it.” He shook his head. “Can I interest you in a nice cup of tea?”</p>
         <p>“A nice cup of tea?” There was that accent again. Less evident now that he was sober,
            but still confusing.</p>
         <p>“Holy fuck, angel. Do you parrot Cal like this?”</p>
         <p>He called her, angel.</p>
         <p>James stepped backwards. “Why in the name of our Lord do you keep staring at me? I’m a
            fecking boy. Have you not noticed us before? We make up half the planet.”</p>
         <p>“I'm sorry.” She snapped out of her daze. “I'm admiring your tattoos.”</p>
         <p>“Don’t they have ink in Kansas?”</p>
         <p>Ha. He knew where she was from, concrete proof he heard about her. She smiled. “You seem
            to know more about me than I know about you.”</p>
         <p>“Wow. It’s capable of conversation.” He rounded the arch into the kitchen.</p>
         <p>She followed, but lingered in the entrance.</p>
         <p>“Okay. You caught me.” He waved a box of tea bags at her. “I know a little bit about
            you. My brother likes to talk about his slappers.”</p>
         <p>From the disgusted twist of his mouth, slapper wasn’t complimentary. He sat the box on
            the counter. A tiny leprechaun danced across the front, leaving a trail of clovers.
            Clovers. James was Irish.</p>
         <p>“Your accent…” she trailed off, unsure of a nasty comeback.</p>
         <p>James finished filling a kettle. “Can it finish a sentence?”</p>
         <p>“Are you English?” Not much of an insult, but from his sneer, she hit a nerve.</p>
         <p>“Wrong. Irish.” He slammed a mug on the counter. “I hate being mistaken for
            English.”</p>
         <p>“I hate being mistaken for a…slapper.”</p>
         <p>He studied her a second. “Touché.”</p>
         <p>“I thought all Irishmen had red hair,” she teased, “are you sure you’re Irish?”</p>
         <p>“Allow me to broaden your knowledge. All Irishmen aren’t redsers. But it’s moot in my
            case because my real father was from the Ukraine. And, to answer your second, brilliant
            question, since I grew up in Belfast and my last name is Fitzpatrick, I'm pretty sure
            I'm Irish.”</p>
         <p>“You and Caleb aren’t real brothers then,” she pointed out, curious how he would
            answer.</p>
         <p>“Not by blood.” He turned his back to her. A second later, he handed her a sunny yellow
            cup with a string hanging over the side. “Honey?”</p>
         <p>“What?”</p>
         <p>“For your tea.”</p>
         <p>He sat on the sofa and blew into his cup. “It's good. Full of antioxidants.”</p>
         <p>“No thanks.” She sat opposite the sofa and sipped her beverage. “Do you speak Gaelic? Or
            Ukrainian?”</p>
         <p>“It's called Irish. Apparently, I think I am fluent when I’ve been drinking. Why do you
            ask?”</p>
         <p>“Sometimes you sound like you have an accent, like when you say fuck as feck. Other
            times, you sound normal.”</p>
         <p>“Feck is the politer version. It’s not an accent.” He balanced his mug on his leg. “But
            otherwise, I’ve been here for a while. I've assimilated. Thanks for your educated
            thoughts on what’s normal though.”</p>
         <p>Crap, she offended him without trying to. “I like the way you talk. Say something in
            Irish.”</p>
         <p>“Tá tú álainn.”</p>
         <p>She blinked, surprised he went along with her request. “What does that mean?”</p>
         <p>“It means, you should go home.”</p>
         <p>She wasn’t sure if he was kidding and didn’t want to leave. When he dropped the sarcasm,
            his banter became fun. “Say purple?”</p>
         <p>“Corcra.”</p>
         <p>“Say dog.”</p>
         <p>He sighed. “Madra.”</p>
         <p>“How do you say, I peed my pants?” How could he not remember an entire night? She tried
            not to smile.</p>
         <p>He kept his gaze on hers. “You look dry from here.”</p>
         <p>She blew into her cup.</p>
         <p>“Pissed me' mo trousers. At least that’s how I'd say it. But I advise against doing it.
            You’re sitting in Cal's favorite chair.” He set his mug on the table. “So, you want to
            know why Cal’s ignoring you?”</p>
         <p>She nodded, mid-sip, eager to find out what she did wrong.</p>
         <p>“He’s just busy.” He narrowed his eyes. “You can drop that puppy dog, ‘I’m so hurt my
            boyfriend is ignoring me,’ act. Cal may be gullible, but I recognize a Siren when I see
            one.”</p>
         <p>“You think I’m a Siren?” Who even used that word?</p>
         <p>James’ gaze drifted south, to her legs. When he looked up, his eyes were dark. “All I’m
            saying is I think you have other motives.”</p>
         <p>“I was too upset to sleep. You still think I’m a man-eater?”</p>
         <p>His expression blanked. “I told you what I thought of you earlier, in Irish.”</p>
         <p>“You wanted me to go home?”</p>
         <p>“I said, I think you are rather beautiful.”</p>
         <p>The word beautiful, sounded exotic coming off his tongue. Damn. Charming. Don’t let him
            charm you.</p>
         <p>“Cover yourself.” He placed a cushion in his lap, then tossed her the fuzzy yellow
            blanket from the back of the sofa. “I've got the air cranked.”</p>
         <p>She draped it around her shoulders. “What are we listening to?”</p>
         <p>“Thrash metal. What do you listen to?”</p>
         <p>“Whatever’s on WKSC. You know, Kiss FM.” She named off some hot female singers, thinking
            he would appreciate their sex appeal, but he grimaced.</p>
         <p>“I like Adele, too.” Adele was her favorite vocalist. She waited for his reaction.</p>
         <p>“Those feckin’ Brits can sing.”</p>
         <p>He clicked the music off and reached for the guitar. “You like Zeppelin?”</p>
         <p>“Sure,” she agreed, though not one Zeppelin song came to mind.</p>
         <p>Eyes closed; he played a melancholy tune. After a minute, he stopped and peered at her.
            “Do you like it?”</p>
         <p>She nodded. “The music’s sad.”</p>
         <p>“It’s about a woman’s journey for meaning in a world of ambiguity. I can play the flute
            parts, too.” He jutted his chin toward the instruments. “The million-dollar question is,
            can you name that song?”</p>
         <p>She had no idea what the song was, and after that deep and insightful speech, she didn’t
            know who James was, either. Shrugging, she set her empty cup down. “I don’t know the
            title, but you sounded good.”</p>
         <p>He nodded like he heard that a lot. “So, angel, fess up.” After adjusting the music to a
            comfortable volume, he reclined, fingers a pyramid in front of his chest. “I’ll be your
            therapist. Tell me what you dreamt about.”</p>
         <p>Telling him she had been forgotten in a hole sounded dumb. “I don’t remember,” she
            said.</p>
         <p>He grinned like he could read her mind. “Dreams are just dreams; life, now that’s
            scary.”</p>
         <p>She may be lonely, but outside of Paul, she had never been scared. James turned the TV
            off and lit a cigarette. Its burning heater possessed hypnotic qualities in the dark
            room.</p>
         <p>“Does Caleb smoke?” Sometimes he smelled like smoke, but she never saw him with a
            cigarette.</p>
         <p>“Ask him.”</p>
         <p>Her eyes fought to close. “Wow. That tea really works. This is the most relaxed I've
            been all year.” Relaxed was an understatement. She struggled to get the words out.</p>
         <p>Her head bobbed. She jerked upright but couldn't escape the sensation of falling off the
            chair. Strong arms encircled her. Lifted her. Pulled her from the pit. She floated
            through space until firmness welcomed her.</p>
         <p>“No bad dreams tonight. I promise,” James’ voice said. She held the hand that belonged
            to the voice and didn't want to let go.</p>
         <p>“Don't leave me,” she imagined saying, squeezing tighter, “keep me safe.”</p>
         <p>The firmness under her shifted, and something warm sided against her. Her fogged brain
            called it a leg. She snuggled against it, enjoying the slight pressure of fingers in her
            hair.</p>
         <p>“Talk to me.” she got out, not scared, just relaxed.</p>
         <p>“Shh,” he said. His chest rose and fell under her cheek. “Dún do shúile. Codial go sámh
            go séimh.”</p>
         <p>“Doon dul hoola” She tried to commit it to memory. “What’s it mean?”</p>
         <p>“Close your eyes, sleep peacefully, gently. My mother used to sing it to me.”</p>
         <p>“That’s nice.” Something in that visual seemed off, but she fell into quiet darkness
            before she could make sense of her scattered thoughts.</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>Sunlight woke her. She was in the pool house bedroom, the blanket tucked tightly around
            her like an Egyptian Mummy. Caleb’s voice came from the next room.</p>
         <p>“You gave her what?” He sounded pissed.</p>
         <p>“One of my sleeping pills,” James said, humor evident in his tone. “Just a piece. You
            should have seen her, poor thing. Wound up tight.”</p>
         <p>Cassie jumped out of bed. She peered through the gap in the door.</p>
         <p>Caleb paced into, then out of, her view. “Why didn't you call me?”</p>
         <p>“Because you suck at being a boyfriend. It’s your fault she hasn't been sleeping. You’ve
            been ignoring her.”</p>
         <p>“I’ve been busy.” Caleb plopped onto a chair in her line of vision. “Busy with you.”</p>
         <p>“I told her that.” James’ said, his voice farther away. “She shows up while I'm asleep,
            wearing just my feckin cacks. I open my eyes and there she is. How am I supposed to know
            what you’d want me to do with her?”</p>
         <p>Caleb pinched the bridge of his nose. “I think it’s safe to assume I wouldn't want you
            drugging her and carrying her off to bed.”</p>
         <p>James drugged her? Drugged her—and tucked her in. Dún do shúile, His words came back.
            Close your eyes. Sleep peacefully.</p>
         <p>“It was just a little drugging.” James paused. “Okay, I'm sorry I drugged your
            girlfriend. I won't do it again.”</p>
         <p>“I didn't realize you had pills left.” Caleb’s voice became all business. “I want
            them.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever.” A container bounced off Caleb’s knee. “I don’t need them.”</p>
         <p>Caleb retrieved the bottle and sat back down.</p>
         <p>“Happy?” James asked, his back to the bedroom. “Hey, think I’m healed enough to go into
            the house? I stashed some cash under your mattress.”</p>
         <p>“You look better,” Caleb said, “but mom will still have a heart attack if she sees
            you.”</p>
         <p>Cassie crossed her legs. As illuminating as their conversation was, she had to pee. A
            daylight assessment of her attire produced a groan. Her top was more transparent than
            she thought. Her brain must have been sleep-deprived last night.</p>
         <p>She pulled on a discarded t-shirt and jerked the bedroom door open. They both turned to
            look at her. A disheveled James, still shirtless and in track pants, hovered by the
            front door.</p>
         <p>She glared at him. “You drugged my tea?”</p>
         <p>He had the decency to blush.</p>
         <p>“What else did you do to me?” She should be angrier, but at no point had she felt
            threatened, and she did have a great sleep.</p>
         <p>He grabbed the doorknob. “Don't flatter yourself.” </p>
         <p>Caleb narrowed his eyes, like he was mad at her comment. His jaw relaxed, and he stood.
            “James, apologize to her.”</p>
         <p>James opened the door. He stepped forward, then stopped, his shoulders sagging. He
            stepped back into the room and slammed the door.</p>
         <p>“Jesus.” He glowered at Caleb. “I’m sorry I drugged your tea, Cassandra. I’m a bad, bad
            boy.” He curtsied.</p>
         <p>“For fuck’s sake,” Caleb muttered, lowering his head into his hands.</p>
         <p>Cassie glanced from one to the other. Shaking her head, she proceeded into the bathroom.
            When she came out, James was gone. She sat on the sofa and waited for Caleb to say
            something.</p>
         <p>He smiled. “I’m sorry I didn't call. I've been preoccupied.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, I get that now.” She didn't have the stamina to be angry. Her brain felt like a
            cement ball.</p>
         <p>“And I’m sorry my friend drugged you. Words I never thought I’d say.”</p>
         <p>“Apologizing for James must be a full-time job.” She sighed. “I shouldn’t have
            insinuated your friend is a pervert.”</p>
         <p>Caleb grew somber. “I know he didn't touch you. He wouldn't do that.”</p>
         <p>“Would he date rape someone you weren't seeing?”</p>
         <p>“Of course not. But I told you, his parents messed him up. I believe in his own way, he
            wanted to help you. James is a lot of things, but he isn't dangerous.” Caleb pulled his
            eyebrows together. “He would never hurt someone defenseless…” Groaning, he shook his
            head in defeat. “Why are you wearing his shirt?”</p>
         <p>“I grabbed it off the floor. To cover this.”</p>
         <p>She lifted the shirt, exposing her gauzy top. His wide eyes rewarded her effort. She may
            be invisible to James, but she effected Caleb.</p>
         <p>“What were you thinking, coming here in the middle of the night? Wearing that.”</p>
         <p>“I was thinking I missed you.”</p>
         <p>His expression softened. He pulled her into his lap and placed a soft kiss on her lips.
            “What did you guys do?”</p>
         <p>“Are you jealous?”</p>
         <p>“Curious.”</p>
         <p>“Curious about me? Or James?” After the last few days, she assumed the latter. “He made
            me tea, as you established, and played me a song.”</p>
         <p>“He played you a song?” His voice tightened. “What song?”</p>
         <p>She shrugged. “I didn’t recognize it.</p>
         <p>“What did he play it on?”</p>
         <p>She pointed to the guitar that rested against the sofa. “It sounded really good.”</p>
         <p>Caleb expelled a deep breath. “James is really talented when it comes to music.”</p>
         <p>“Among other things.” James let the door slam behind him. He scanned her then flopped
            onto the sofa, lips twisted in disgust. “You might want to put some bottoms on.”</p>
         <p>No longer comfortable, she moved to get up, but Caleb wrapped his arms about her. “How’d
            it go in the house?”</p>
         <p>“Not good.” James reached for the remote. “Mom freaked. I told her I fell, which is the
            fecking truth for once, and she thinks I'm lying. Maybe you should go see her. She tried
            to check out the damage and I backed away. Go let her hug on you or something. Tell her
            I'm sorry.”</p>
         <p>Caleb leaned past Cassie. “Don't feel bad. She understands.”</p>
         <p>Whatever they were talking about didn't sound like any of her business. And for once,
            her inquisitive nature had been quelled. Her head hurt enough without trying to decode
            their bromance.</p>
         <p>She pried Caleb’s arms loose. “I need to go. I’m meeting Allison to work on an
            assignment.”</p>
         <p>“Wait.” James tossed the remote onto the cushion. He rummaged through the basket of
            folded laundry next to the sofa, then threw her a pair of joggers. “You can't leave
            wearing just your drawers.”</p>
         <p>“Drawers?” she questioned as she slipped the track pants on.</p>
         <p>Caleb raised his shoulders in an uninterested half shrug. “When his words make no sense,
            nod and pretend you get what he’s talking about. By the way. Was he right? Cassie stands
            for Cassandra.”</p>
         <p>She hated to admit James guessed correctly but nodded. Though the conversation was about
            him, James flipped through the stations, seemingly uninterested.</p>
         <p>“Pretty,” Caleb said, “I like it.” He leaned in to kiss her.</p>
         <p>James looked up from the TV, an unlit cigarette between his lips. He caught her gaze and
            raised an eyebrow.</p>
         <p>Closing her eyes, she concentrated on moving her lips.</p>

         <h4>Chapter 6</h4>
         <p>Cassie stepped from the darkness of the Logan Theater and blinked into the late
            afternoon sun. Heat rippled from the sidewalk, but it smelled like rain. She pulled at
            the collar of her shirt. July on her grandpa’s farm never felt this suffocating.</p>
         <p>Caleb touched her shoulder. “Admit it. You liked the movie.”</p>
         <p>Not wanting to burst his bubble, she nodded her approval. “How did I survive without
            Slasher Saturday?”</p>
         <p>The movie had been okay, but the best part was that they were alone. James wasn’t
            hanging over them, breathing down her neck, tying her stomach into knots.</p>
         <p>Spending the last week stuck between the two of them required patience. James seemed to
            enjoy making her mad enough to say something rude, just so Caleb would get annoyed with
            her and be forced to choose sides.</p>
         <p>The last movie they saw, James insisted on tagging along. As soon as the lights dimmed,
            he retrieved a flask from his pocket and got so drunk and obnoxious they were asked to
            leave. Caleb didn’t seem angry then, but he avoided bringing him this time.</p>
         <p>“How are your classes going?” Caleb leaned against the theater’s brick façade, hands in
            his pockets, allowing her time to get her bearings and lead the way home—a game he made
            up to teach her the city.</p>
         <p>“I'm meeting a lot of people. At least I won't feel like a stranger this fall.” She
            studied the opposite direction. There had to be a landmark somewhere, but the area held
            no clues, not even a street sign.</p>
         <p>He chuckled. “You have no idea where you are, do you?”</p>
         <p>They caught a taxi there, and she was texting Allison, not paying attention. She faced
            him and shrugged.</p>
         <p>“Do you want me to tell you where the lake is?” Caleb straightened up. “Or point you
            toward the blue line?”</p>
         <p>Her stomach growled. “Let's get cupcakes at Molly's. Aren't we close enough to walk?” It
            was a stab in the dark.</p>
         <p>“Molly’s is east of here, Cassie.” He tugged at his bottom lip, unable to hide his
            amusement. “We're on the other side of the Kennedy.”</p>
         <p>She checked the skyline. James insisted if she looked at the tops of the buildings, she
            would never be lost. To prove his point, he rattled off skyscraper names while pointing
            at their rooflines, surprising her and Caleb with how many he recognized.</p>
         <p>“That way is south.” She gestured to her right. “Which means it’s the way home.”</p>
         <p>“Correct.” Caleb looped his arm over her shoulder as they headed down Milwaukee. “And I
            know of a little diner with great food and fast service not much farther down the
            street.”</p>
         <p>She relaxed into his side, enjoying his undivided attention.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Fifties rock blasted from the crowded restaurant. Caleb led her past a row of occupied
            bar stools to a shiny, laminated booth. “They have great shakes here.”</p>
         <p>Red vinyl cooled her bare legs as she slipped across from him. She looped her ankles
            around his calf. Though it was busy, the waitress appeared instantaneous.</p>
         <p>“I’m not that hungry,” she lied, “but can we split a strawberry shake?” It seemed like a
            relationship thing, and secretly something she always wanted to do.</p>
         <p>Caleb ordered the shake, a coffee, and a piece of apple pie with two forks, then pulled
            his cell from his pants pocket. “Hope the world hasn't gone to hell,” he said, unmuting
            his phone.</p>
         <p>More like he hoped James hadn't. A comment she bit back.</p>
         <p>The waitress returned. Caleb slid the shake to the middle of the table and bent a straw
            toward her. “Go ahead.” He flashed his dimples, then took a drink.</p>
         <p>She leaned forward. Lumps of ice cream blocked the straw. She finally managed to get a
            taste when Caleb’s phone beeped, no doubt James’ calling to claim her boyfriend. She
            snatched the phone and sat against the seat. His locked phone offered no clues if her
            guess was right.</p>
         <p>“What are you doing?” Caleb retreated from the shake.</p>
         <p>“Checking your messages. That's okay, isn’t it?” Didn’t couples answer each other’s
            phones all the time? She extended the device over the table. “Can you unlock it?”</p>
         <p>He obliged her, then sat back. With crossed arms and knit brows he waited.</p>
         <p>“You have a snap,” she informed him, as she scrolled his notifications. “It’s from
            James. Can I delete it without looking?” They’d been James-free for less than four
            hours. It wasn’t fair.</p>
         <p>Caleb laughed but shook his head.</p>
         <p>A selfie of James and some girl filled the screen. They held shot glasses, Caleb’s pool
            in the background. Get home, the caption read.</p>
         <p>The last thing she wanted to do was hang with James while he molested some poor girl.
            She dropped the phone into Caleb’s outstretched hand and finished the shake while he
            checked his phone.</p>
         <p>“Looks like I'm having a party,” he said.</p>
         <p>“There goes our evening.” She leaned back. “Why do you always have to keep tabs on
            him?”</p>
         <p>“You've seen what happens when I don't.”</p>
         <p>It wasn’t her boyfriend’s job to keep his friend safe. She sighed, loud enough to make
            her feelings known.</p>
         <p>“Anyway.” Caleb ate a forkful of pie. “Didn’t I get a lecture from you about wanting to
            go to parties?” He pushed the plate toward her and reached for his coffee. “We've been
            watching a lot of TV. I feel fat.”</p>
         <p>“Fat? You could model with those abs.”</p>
         <p>Caleb choked on his coffee.</p>
         <p>“Are you okay?” She handed him a napkin.</p>
         <p>“Sorry. That must have gone down the wrong way.” He went back to his phone.</p>
         <p>Cassie grabbed a fork. Her parents were returning tomorrow, but their vacation had
            morphed into a week. Last night saw the end of the pizza rolls, and this morning she ate
            the last egg, without toast. Not wanting Caleb or his mom to feel required to feed her,
            she kept her mouth shut about her dwindling food supplies.</p>
         <p>“Ready?” Caleb set a twenty-dollar bill under the corner of the plate and moved to the
            edge of the booth.</p>
         <p>“Wait.” She grabbed his hand. “Can’t we do something else tonight. Alone?”</p>
         <p>For all the time she spent with Caleb, he hadn’t pushed past the kissing stage, and as
            pleasant as that was, she’d rather get the, lose your virginity stage over with so she
            could move onto the, firmly planted in your life, part.</p>
         <p>His eyes widened with understanding. “I’m enjoying how slow this is going.” He tugged
            her from the booth. “I like that you do the little stuff with me. We have time for other
            stuff later.”</p>
         <p>A sentiment she would have loved to hear last year—from Paul. But not now. Not from
            Caleb.</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>Raindrops dotted the taxi windows on the ride home. James’ black Mustang occupied
            Caleb’s driveway, along with another car. A strong indicator the intermittent drizzle
            hadn’t ruined the festivities like Cassie hoped.</p>
         <p>The faint beat of a bass line echoed from the backyard. She waited while Caleb opened
            the Mustang's door. He checked the ignition, then the visor. “Damn it. James has the
            keys.”</p>
         <p>He slammed the door and headed to the gate.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Two thin, blonde girls occupied the cushioned chairs around the pool, while a
            dark-haired girl, her tight curls cut in a super short pixie, goofed off in the water
            with Ron. Cassie did the math. Three boys and three girls—making her the odd one out. A
            typical James’ move.</p>
         <p>James grinned from where he relaxed on a lounger, legs on either side, shirt open. His
            red, white, and blue trunks carried a crested logo.</p>
         <p>Caleb hugged the blondes then kicked the foot of James’ chair. “Where’s Mom?”</p>
         <p>“Inside.” James shot Cassie a glance. “She said we could have a couple beers if we
            stayed put.”</p>
         <p>Caleb picked up a bottle that read ‘Voodoo Tiki’ and scowled at the back of his house.
            “Being this close to her when we’re getting wrecked is a serious buzz kill.”</p>
         <p>Another buzz kill, Cassie wanted to say, was when your boyfriend fails to introduce you
            to their beautiful female company. She considered herself pretty, but these girls were
            gorgeous. Refusing to look hurt, she crossed her arms and smiled as Caleb retreated
            across the grass to the coverage of the vined perogola.</p>
         <p>“Chill out, dude,” James called after him. He swung his leg over the cushion and stood.
            “You forgot to introduce your girlfriend. Come over here, angel.”</p>
         <p>The word angel produced a nasty glare from the girl with poker straight hair, an obvious
            warning to stay away. Cassie stared back. She wasn’t interested in James or fooled by
            his bogus attempt at chivalry.</p>
         <p>James brushed past her. “That's Alexa.” He pointed to the unhappy blonde girl. “And
            Lauren. Nia’s in the pool.” Nia splashed water at him. He waved a naughty finger in
            response. “Everyone, this is Cassie.”</p>
         <p>At least he didn’t introduce her as 'angel,’ Every time he called her that, she heated
            into a blush. Probably the exact reason he did it.</p>
         <p>He flipped into the deep end, shirt on, leaving her alone on the deck. She gave everyone
            a slight wave, not that any of them noticed, then headed across the yard after
            Caleb.</p>
         <p>“Sorry for not introducing you,” he said as she approached. “It creeps me out that my
            mom might be watching.” He took a drink of the blue liquid then winced. “She can’t see
            me here.”</p>
         <p>“We can move to my backyard. Just the two of us.” Her house sat, empty as usual. “No one
            is watching me.”</p>
         <p>“I’m watching,” he whispered into her ear, then pulled her into a tight hug. A sweet
            sentiment, and exactly what she needed.</p>
         <p>Commotion in the pool caught her attention. Nia had wrapped herself around James and
            pulled at his shirt. Alexa jumped into the water, almost on top of them. As if he could
            feel her watching, James looked up. He gave her a wicked grin, then dove under. Nia
            shrieked before disappearing beneath the water.</p>
         <p>Caleb stepped back. “Can we move this party to your house? I'll feel less like I'm being
            spied on—if I'm not being spied on.”</p>
         <p>That was a definite no. “My parents get home tomorrow. They’d kill me.”</p>
         <p>“They'd never know.”</p>
         <p>Those big blue eyes of his could beg all night, but she wasn't inviting these strangers
            into her home. Wrapping her arms around Caleb’s neck, she said, “You, can come over. I
            won’t be able to see you tomorrow. I’ve got plans with my dad.”</p>
         <p>Something cold splattered her back and she jerked around. James stood behind her,
            shaking water from himself like a dog.</p>
         <p>“Ew.” She ran her hands over her arms.</p>
         <p>“Holy feck.” James laughed. “It’s pool water, not piss.” He swiped away the rogue drops
            rolling down his cheeks, then pointed to the bottle in Caleb’s hand. “Ronnie wants to
            play caps for tequila shots.”</p>
         <p>“Shit,” Caleb said, “You always win at that game.”</p>
         <p>Cassie latched onto Caleb’s arm. “Aren’t we going to my house?”</p>
         <p>“I need to stay here, Cassie.” Caleb handed over the bottle. “Sorry.”</p>
         <p>A satisfied grin spread across James' face. “Sweet. Go put some shorts on. Ron’s
            waiting, already.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie remained under the pergola while Caleb changed. It wasn't like the trio of girls
            wanted anything to do with her. Lauren seemed approachable but shared a chaise with Nia
            who laughed drunkenly at something on Lauren’s phone. To Cassie’s surprise, they
            kissed.</p>
         <p>Alexa continued to scowl. At least Ron was there. Short and stocky with cropped brown
            hair, he resembled the guys back home, not someone out of a magazine.</p>
         <p>James hit a switch and soft, overhead lights brightened the darkening yard. He
            positioned himself on the pavers at an angle from Ron, and like Ron, stretched his legs
            into a V. He placed an empty beer bottle between his thighs and set an upside-down beer
            cap on top.</p>
         <p>She hedged closer.</p>
         <p>“Do they play this in Kansas?” James asked, stacking the bottle caps Alexa brought
            him.</p>
         <p>“Yes,” she said, though she’d never seen the game before and could count the number of
            alcohol-related parties she’d attended on one hand.</p>
         <p>The corner of his mouth twitched. “Let’s see your moves.”</p>
         <p>She hung back. “I’m good here.”</p>
         <p>“I’ll show you my moves,” Alexa offered.</p>
         <p>“Come on,” James persisted, “show me how the culchies party in Kansas.”</p>
         <p>“I think Kansas is a great state,” Nia offered.</p>
         <p>“James,” Caleb warned as he approached. He’d changed into cargo shorts and a University
            of Notre Dame t-shirt. James flipped a cap at him. It hit the leprechaun logo square
            on.</p>
         <p>“Remember.” Caleb pulled a chair alongside the game and motioned for Cassie to sit. “You
            promised to be nice.” He plopped down, facing the others like the third point of a
            triangle.</p>
         <p>“Relax, Callie.” James lit a cigarette and let it dangle from the corner of his mouth.
            “She knows I’m slagging her.</p>
         <p>Caleb chuckled. “You better hope Mom doesn’t see that thing.”</p>
         <p>“I keep telling you. She’s not watching.” James didn't sound concerned but lifted his
            eyes to the back of the house. “Besides, I play better when I smoke.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>An hour into the game, Ron crawled to the bushes and puked. “I’m okay,” he said, as he
            collapsed into a heap on the grass. “Just going to lie here a while.”</p>
         <p>Caleb burst into laughter but didn’t look any better. He was going to lose, or perhaps
            already lost. Cassie wasn't sure what the rules were, or if the game was over.</p>
         <p>“Here, Caleb.” Alexa sat behind James; her long, bare legs stretched on either side of
            his. “I'll handicap him for you.” She helped herself to the cigarette dangling between
            his lips and took a drag before replacing it.</p>
         <p>James inched forward but chided, “You're going to have to do more than sit if you want
            to handicap me.”</p>
         <p>The challenge brought a smile to Alexa’s face. She slipped her hands into his bathing
            suit pockets.</p>
         <p>Still seated at the end of the lounge, Lauren glanced up from her phone. “Nice, Alexa.
            Real classy.” She pushed Nia’s legs off. The girl moaned but didn’t wake up.</p>
         <p>James jerked his elbow into his crotch. “Darling, don’t touch me there. That is my no-no
            square.”</p>
         <p>The motion in his shorts ignited Cassie’s cheeks. She glared at him. Did they not have
            any sense of decency?</p>
         <p>A beer cap bounced off James’ head. “Play now, screw later.” Caleb raised another
            cap.</p>
         <p>“You should quit while you can still walk, Cal—and you,” he bumped back into Alexa, “can
            save it for another time.”</p>
         <p>“Don’t patronize me.” Caleb placed a cap on top of his bottle, half over the rim. “Take
            your damn shot.”</p>
         <p>James sighed, but shot. Caleb’s cap hit the ground.</p>
         <p>“Fuck.” Caleb struggled to his feet.</p>
         <p>Cassie shot James a dirty look and sprung to Caleb’s aid.</p>
         <p>“Fucking guy.” He grabbed her arm. “I can never beat him at this game.” He staggered
            toward the house, her arm tight in his grasp.</p>
         <p>She stumbled up the back steps and broke free in the middle of the kitchen.</p>
         <p>“Cal. Is that you?” Elizabeth rounded the corner. “Oh.” Her hand rose to her throat.
            “James insisted he only had a six pack.”</p>
         <p>“Well, Mom, he was wrong.” Caleb leaned on the center island for support. “Imagine that.
            James wrong. Will the sun rise tomorrow?” Arms spread, he stumbled backward. “By the
            way, Cassie wants to spend the night.”</p>
         <p>“I was only bringing him to the door, Mrs. Patterson.” She wanted more intimacy, but
            there was no way she would follow him to his room with his mom watching. Besides, from
            the expression on Elizabeth's face, that wasn’t an option.</p>
         <p>“Cassie's heading home,” Elizabeth said. She crossed to the door as if she planned to
            check outside, then changed her mind. “What sort of shape is James in?”</p>
         <p>Cassie shrugged. James seemed sober, but his many states of inebriation confused
            her.</p>
         <p>“Did the other girls leave? I don't want them staying in the pool house.”</p>
         <p>Under different circumstances, Cassie would have laughed. She was pretty sure it was a
            little late to worry about James' virtue.</p>
         <p>“I think they left.” She glanced at Caleb, but he wasn’t in any shape to offer input.
            “See you later, Mrs. Patterson.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie eyed her house from the top step. In utter darkness, it was as far from warm and
            inviting as it could get. Her stomach sank at the thought of trying to sleep there,
            alone. Caleb didn’t realize how lucky he was to have a mom who worried about him.</p>
         <p>She descended the stairs. Alexa’s legs were still around James' hips and Lauren and Nia
            hadn’t moved from the lounge.</p>
         <p>James ground out his cigarette then faced Alexa. She chirped in surprise as he lifted
            her and laid her on the pavers, pinning her with his body.</p>
         <p>“Alexa, stop flirting. I have to go.” Lauren sounded sober. She stroked Nia’s arm.
            “We’re leaving.”</p>
         <p>In one fluid motion, James got to his feet. He stretched his arms behind his head and
            yawned. His gaze landed on Cassie.</p>
         <p>Alexa glared at her. “Don't you live over there?” She pointed to Cassie’s house. “Why
            don’t you run along. It’s past your bedtime.”</p>
         <p>Lauren appeared apologetic, but Alexa was horrible. Cassie wouldn’t hang out with them
            if they paid her. She took a few steps, intent on leaving, when James clamped his
            fingers around her wrist.</p>
         <p>“Go home,” he said to Alexa. “I'll call you later.”</p>
         <p>Alexa clambered to her feet. “Fuck you, James. Don’t call till you’ve grown up enough to
            want a woman.”</p>
         <p>She pushed past Cassie and disappeared behind the garage. Her friends followed,
            laughing. The gate slammed shut, leaving Cassie alone with James—again. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 7</h4>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>James released her to mess with his phone and mellow music replaced the heavier stuff
            blasting earlier. Cassie didn’t recognize the band, but after her last encounter alone
            with him, she didn’t plan on sticking around to ask questions.</p>
         <p>“Don’t scamper off,” he called out as she reached the garage. “Come back here.”</p>
         <p>The hair on her arm bristled, but she stomped over to where he relaxed against the arm
            of one of the Adirondacks; bare feet planted in the grass.</p>
         <p>He pulled a vial out of his pocket and uncapped the lid. Little white pills filled the
            palm of his hand. “Want one?”</p>
         <p>She wrinkled her nose. “What are those?”</p>
         <p>“Yokes.” The pills appeared incandescent under the string of overhead lighting. He
            jiggled them around.</p>
         <p>“English, please.” She needed a dictionary to talk to this guy. “I’m not Caleb; I don’t
            understand your gibberish.”</p>
         <p> “It’s ecstasy. Try one.”</p>
         <p>“Didn't you already get a lecture about giving me pills?” She squared her shoulders.
            “And I'm not hanging around if you take any.”</p>
         <p>Annoyance clouded his features before he broke into his trademark smirk. “Okay. Don't
            freak out. See, I'm putting them away.” He recapped the vial and shoved it into his
            pocket. “Do you have something against drinking, or am I allowed?”</p>
         <p>“I don't want to be back here with you if you're getting wasted.”</p>
         <p>“Can I smoke?”</p>
         <p>She shrugged. “Your lungs.”</p>
         <p>He lit a cigarette, his attention on the house. “Poor Callie. Hope he's passed out and
            not up there boking—I mean puking.”</p>
         <p>“What was up with Caleb?” The whole kitchen encounter baffled her. “He walked into his
            house like it never occurred to him it might be a bad idea.”</p>
         <p>James peered toward the dark, upstairs windows. “Tequila messes with your mind. I doubt
            Cal knew what planet he was on.”</p>
         <p>“He tried to bring me past his mom. To his room.” She glanced over to catch his
            reaction.</p>
         <p>“No way.” He exhaled a puff of smoke. “His mother saw him? Shit. I’ll never hear the end
            of this. First from Cal, for letting his mom catch him all pissed up. Then, from his
            mom. I told her I just had a few beer.”</p>
         <p>“Will she blame you?” That didn’t seem fair. James hadn’t forced anyone to drink. “She
            asked about you, too.”</p>
         <p>“Nah, she knows I'm not always the devil.” He looked away. “What did she say about
            me?”</p>
         <p>“She wanted to know if the girls had left. She didn't want them in the pool house with
            you.”</p>
         <p>He huffed like he found that as comical as she had. “What’d you tell her?”</p>
         <p>“I told her they’d left, and she told me to go straight home.”</p>
         <p>“Look at you, lying to Cal's mom.” His expression turned mischievous. “And you're still
            here. Why haven’t you run?”</p>
         <p>“Not sure.” She swallowed. “Why did you call me back?”</p>
         <p>“I want to hang a bit, find out what my brother sees in you.”</p>
         <p>It didn’t sound like an insult, but it felt like one. She wandered to the remains of
            their drinking game and righted Caleb’s beer bottle. “How come you always win?”</p>
         <p>Brows knit, he studied her from his roost on the chair’s arm, then pushed himself
            upright. He placed a cap, upside-down on the bottle’s top. After pacing a few feet away,
            he tapped the ground with his foot. “Come here. I’ll show you.”</p>
         <p>“I’m not sure that’s a good idea.” Akin to playing with fire.</p>
         <p>“It will be craic. Fun,” he said, “I’m not that scary.”</p>
         <p>It wasn’t that he scared her. He earned her trust the night she showed up almost naked
            and he hadn’t given her a second glance. But with Caleb, she could control how she felt.
            Around James, she was free-falling.</p>
         <p>She sat on the pavers, facing the bottle, legs extended. Before she could protest, James
            slid down behind her. Her shoulders stiffened. She glanced toward Caleb’s house.</p>
         <p>“Whoa. Relax, angel.” James stretched his legs alongside hers, like Alexa had done to
            him. “This is the best way to teach you.”</p>
         <p>His lips were behind her ear, his hands on either side of her waist. Was that his mouth
            that brushed her neck? None of it calmed her nerves.</p>
         <p>“Spread your legs wider,” he whispered, his chest pressed against her spine. “You’ll get
            better balance.”</p>
         <p>She adjusted her position, allowing another sliver of space.</p>
         <p>“A bit more.” A warm puff of breath heated her neck with his chuckle. He inched her legs
            apart. The tips of his fingers lingered, hot on her bare thighs. “That's better. Now
            pick up a cap.”</p>
         <p>She plucked up one of the scattered beer caps and tried to focus, but her body hummed,
            alive with its own agenda.</p>
         <p>“Hold it this way.” He demonstrated with his own cap, but she couldn’t grip hers
            right.</p>
         <p>“Like this.” He manipulated her fingers around the tiny object then squeezed her hand.
            “We're both ciotoʹgs. Left-handed.”</p>
         <p>The lesson may as well have been in Greek. The heat of his body and the sensation of
            being in his arms overloaded her circuits.</p>
         <p>“Now flick it.” His voice was thick. The cap went wide. It rolled into the grass.</p>
         <p>“You missed,” she said, not much louder than a whisper.</p>
         <p>For a second, there was no answer.</p>
         <p>“Yeah,” he replied in an equally quiet voice.</p>
         <p>There was no doubt his lips grazed her skin this time. His chin found the sensitive area
            at the base of her neck. He rested his hands on her legs and sucked in a deep breath,
            the sensation intimate against her back, his slow exhale steamy against her
            shoulder.</p>
         <p>Neither moved. She held her breath until tension and oxygen deprivation threatened her
            judgment. She needed space.</p>
         <p>“I think your girlfriend wants to hurt me. This is the last position she would want you
            to be in.” Not that Caleb would be thrilled, either.</p>
         <p>“If you’re referring to Alexa, she isn’t my girlfriend.”</p>
         <p>Cassie scooted forward. Enough to turn and face him. He drew his knees up quick. “Can I
            help you?”</p>
         <p>“I'll play you caps,” she said, “for questions and answers.”</p>
         <p>“Didn't realize you were curious.”</p>
         <p>“Not curious.” She moved backward, her legs around their target bottle. “Just
            bored.”</p>
         <p>His forehead creased, then he huffed. “I'm not great with personal inquiries. I may not
            answer.”</p>
         <p>“Neither may I.” Other than the Paul incident, she had nothing to hide, but the comment
            sounded mysterious.</p>
         <p>He nodded, then set up across from her. So near, their feet almost touched.</p>
         <p>“Could you get any closer?” she said, “I could practically blow your cap off.”</p>
         <p>The comment produced a chuckle. “I'm taking it easy on you, Kansas. Ready when you
            are.”</p>
         <p>Ignoring his consistent smugness, she held her cap as instructed. She expected him to
            say something awful, but his smile didn’t waver. Using her own technique, she flung the
            cap. It sailed through the air and sent his cap flying off the bottle.</p>
         <p>“Beginner’s luck.” He shook his head. “Ask away.”</p>
         <p>“Do you like Alexa?”</p>
         <p>“What do you care?”</p>
         <p>“I can't think of anything else to ask.”</p>
         <p>“Hmm.” He rubbed his chin. “Truthfully, I didn't like any of the girls here. Although,
            I'm beginning to find one of them rather intriguing.”</p>
         <p>The meaning was clear. She brushed dirt off her leg. “Your turn.”</p>
         <p>“I know whose turn it is, angel.” The cap he'd been fingering whizzed toward her bottle
            and sent hers flying. He studied her a moment. “Do you like Cal?”</p>
         <p>She nodded, then flung another cap. It wobbled through the air and hit him in the
            crotch.</p>
         <p>Smirking, he scooped it up. “I think you're aiming for the wrong target.” His cap hit
            hers again. She waited for the next question.</p>
         <p>“Are you really a virgin?”</p>
         <p>“James!” Caleb had a big mouth. “I don't see how that is any of your business.”</p>
         <p>He grinned. “Answer the question. And remember, this interrogation was your idea.”</p>
         <p>“I am. So what?”</p>
         <p>“Don't be mad. It's rare around here, but I like it.”</p>
         <p>She flung her cap at his bottle. It hit the glass and the cap vibrated off. “Did you
            sleep with Alexa?”</p>
         <p>“Why do you blather on about her so? You sound like Cal.”</p>
         <p>“I’m waiting.”</p>
         <p>His expression twisted, a weird mixture of smugness and revulsion. “I've gotten off with
            all those girls. Not sure they realize they've been to the same party.”</p>
         <p>“That’s disgusting.”</p>
         <p>“That’s life.” He held her gaze. “Honestly, most of the time it’s just Alexa. That’s why
            she thinks she owns me.”</p>
         <p>After spending so much time wrestling information out of Caleb, she appreciated James’
            candor. Her cap clinked off.</p>
         <p>He tilted his head. “What’s with your line of questioning?”</p>
         <p>“Just wondering.”</p>
         <p>“So, you are curious about me—not bored.” His gaze stayed on her. “Your turn.”</p>
         <p>Her cheeks heated. She threw her cap, and in a lucky strike it hit his dead on.</p>
         <p>“What happened to your parents?” she asked as he gaped open-mouthed toward the ground
            where the beer cap lay.</p>
         <p>“Game’s over.” In his haste to leave he hit the bottle with his leg. It shattered.
            Groaning, he shut the music down, then paced a wide circle around her.</p>
         <p>A lump formed in her throat; she’d been told not to mention his parents. She shouldn’t
            have pried.</p>
         <p>James circled again, then extended his arm. “Don’t stress. It’s no big deal.”</p>
         <p>His hand was warm, but not sweaty. Smooth. She rose to her feet and lifted her eyes to
            his. He relinquished his grip with a quick jerk.</p>
         <p>“I’m starving,” he said as he collected glass, “want to go eat?”</p>
         <p>No, would be the appropriate answer but the last thing she ate was the pie she shared
            with Caleb. “Okay.”</p>
         <p>The flicker of surprise that crossed James’ face put a smile on hers.</p>
         <p>“Cool.” He set the broken shards on the table and headed toward the pool house. “I’ll go
            change.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The single beam of light radiating from the fridge’s water dispenser made the tiny house
            seem sleepy; not that she could have slept right now.</p>
         <p>“I’ll be quick,” James promised when she chose to hover by the window instead of
            sitting. He pulled his phone from his pocket and handed it to her. “Password’s the year
            of my car, 1969. Check out my playlist. Let me know if you like anything.” He left the
            bathroom door ajar and a second later the shower started.</p>
         <p>She propped her elbows on the windowsill and punched the numbers into James’ cell. An
            eagle-like bird appeared with the word Provisionals, followed by several apps. He gave
            her his actual password. She set the device on the ledge.</p>
         <p>Standing in the pool house with the sound of the shower and the constant, comforting hum
            of the air conditioner, the night seemed peaceful. Tranquil not suffocating, the way it
            felt in her bedroom.</p>
         <p>The bathroom door creaked. James slipped into the bedroom, a towel around his hips. A
            minute later, he emerged wearing ripped skinny jeans and an undone button-down shirt.
            His swimming trunks may have exposed more skin, but his tattoos seemed extra enticing
            half-hidden under the doaned fly of his jeans.</p>
         <p>Her stomach flipped, but she grunted in disgust. “In case you didn’t realize, shirts
            have buttons for a reason. And your pants couldn't get any lower if you pulled them
            off.”</p>
         <p>“Button me up if it bothers you.” The suggestion sounded wicked. He stepped closer,
            bringing the fresh scent of soap. His mouth twitched. “You always appear so shocked,
            angel.”</p>
         <p>She pushed him away. “Stop flirting.”</p>
         <p>“Is that what I'm doing? You're the one staring at my crotch.”</p>
         <p>“I am not.” God, she had been. “I just wondered what it looks like below your
            waistband.”</p>
         <p>James laughed.</p>
         <p>“The tattoo,” she replied quickly.</p>
         <p>“I'd offer to show you what it looks like, but that would be all shades of
            inappropriate.” He slipped his bare feet into a pair of black Converse. “You do
            remember, you’re my brother’s girlfriend? Which also means I wouldn't be flirting with
            you.”</p>
         <p>“I know whose girlfriend I am. It's just you're usually so shitty when Caleb’s
            around.”</p>
         <p>“Cal's asleep, and I don't want to sit here by myself. I can be an asshole tomorrow if
            you prefer me like that.” Hair draped his face as he buttoned his shirt. He cuffed his
            sleeves and cocked his head. “Better?</p>
         <p>“Yes.” It wasn’t. Half-naked—fully-clothed; it made no difference to the quiver in her
            stomach.</p>
         <p>He jingled keys from a hook and held the pool house door open. Shit, why hadn't she
            considered they might be driving somewhere?</p>
         <p>“Jaysus,” he said, “what’s wrong now?”</p>
         <p>“Are you okay to drive?”</p>
         <p>“Of course, I am. Contrary to popular belief, I don't have a death wish.”</p>
         <p>She didn’t move.</p>
         <p>His eyes narrowed, then he blinked. “I’m not plastered. Get in my car, and I'll tell you
            how I win at caps—and why I'm sober.”</p>
         <p>Relenting, she snatched his phone off the sill and waved it in the air. “Don’t you want
            this?”</p>
         <p>“Keep it in your purse.” He grinned. “I don’t need it. I’m playing with you right now.

         <h4>Chapter 8</h4>
         <p>From the passenger window of James’ Mustang, it looked like he brought her to a huge
            skate park. High overhead lighting lit the area like a ballfield; there was no
            restaurant in sight.</p>
         <p>James slowed past a trio of guys drumming upside-down plastic containers, then pulled
            into one of the few available spots. A group of kids shuffled over so he could park.
            They nodded in unison as Cassie got out of the car. Most of them were dressed in black
            but one of the girls had bright pink hair. Another girl had no hair and wore a fake
            snake necklace.</p>
         <p>The snake moved and Cassie gasped.</p>
         <p>There were some kids in Blue Valley that pushed the fashion limits of the suburban high
            school, but nothing like this.</p>
         <p>James grabbed her hand and headed down a walkway to the underside of a tall vertical
            jump. She didn’t notice the door till it opened. A man with a tag that read security
            stood inside the entrance.</p>
         <p>“Cal and I used to hang here all the time,” James said as they passed through a metal
            detector and proceeded down a steep incline.</p>
         <p>The floor leveled into a cavernous restaurant, its noise and smell in line with a school
            cafeteria. James sped through the sea of tables. They rounded two narrow corners and
            entered a less populated room, lit with flashing neon signs. He brought her to the back
            corner, released her hand, and slid onto the red velvet bench seat, facing the wall.</p>
         <p>Cassie sat across from him and clasped her hands. Going somewhere with James had to be
            the stupidest thing she’d done since moving to Chicago.</p>
         <p>She peeked over his shoulder. “That tall, skinny guy had vampire fangs.” He smiled as
            she passed, and his gaze lingered on her from three booths over. “I’m sure his teeth had
            points. Or maybe it was a lip ring.”</p>
         <p>“I saw him smile at you. They’re fangs.” He watched her. “You look surprised by all
            this. Haven’t you heard of goth? I bet you don't even know what emo is?”</p>
         <p>“I do so know what emo is. I lived in Kansas, not under a rock.”</p>
         <p>James leaned forward. “Unless you want to see me get into a fight, I suggest you stop
            eyeballing that fanged arse.”</p>
         <p>“Is that why we're sitting back here? If these people scare you, why’d you bring me
            here?”</p>
         <p>“I'm not scared—and you shouldn’t be, either. We're back here because I want to keep
            this low-key.”</p>
         <p>“This is an odd place to take me if you wanted privacy. We just paraded past a million
            people.”</p>
         <p>He bumped her hand. “I'm counting on the masses to keep me out of trouble.”</p>
         <p>Not wanting to hazard a guess as to what he meant by trouble, she waited for him to
            continue. But he only reclined against the seat, his narrowed eyes focused on her.</p>
         <p>The waitress came over. Nodding politely, he ordered two coffees and two breakfast
            specials.</p>
         <p>“I usually get to pick out my food,” she said, “In case you haven’t noticed, I’m not
            eight.”</p>
         <p>“I noticed,” he answered in the thoughtful tone she was beginning to connect to his
            personality. “I usually order when I bother to take a girl out. They never care. They’re
            more interested in the itinerary than the food.”</p>
         <p>“What kind of girls do you take out?” No doubt Anorexic Alexa. The itinerary probably
            included knocking the plates off the table so they could screw.</p>
         <p>He pointed to their waitress, visible through the doorway. “I’ll go tell her if you want
            something different. And I promise to keep mum next time we're in a restaurant
            together.”</p>
         <p>It would be worth changing her order to watch him make nice with the waitress, but the
            breakfast special sounded good. “It's okay,” she said, “you guessed right. I would have
            gotten that, anyway.”</p>
         <p>The sharp edges of his features softened. His top lip twitched, and he broke into a
            genuine smile. One she mirrored.</p>
         <p>“You have a great smile.” She meant it as a compliment, but as soon as she said it, he
            scowled—also not a bad look.</p>
         <p>The waitress delivered their coffee. Cassie added cream and sugar. “I'm still waiting
            for an explanation about how you win at caps.”</p>
         <p>“Here's the thing.” James’ gaze skirted the room. “You can't say anything, or Cal will
            kill me. Agreed?”</p>
         <p>She nodded.</p>
         <p>“I'm a good shot, and…I fake drinking.” His cheeks turned a rosy hue, harmonious with
            the neon lips, hung over his head.</p>
         <p>“You fake drinking? Is that even possible?”</p>
         <p>“I take the first few shots; then, when my opponent gets too drunk to notice, which
            happens because I'm a good shot, I don't take every hit.”</p>
         <p>“Really.” She laughed. “You cheat.”</p>
         <p>“I’m good, so it's not cheating, and sometimes I do drink. But occasionally, like
            tonight, when I want to do other things, I don't feel like getting ossified.”</p>
         <p>Like tonight. The words echoed in her head. She sipped her coffee. “That's still not
            fair.</p>
         <p>“Poor little buttercup. Who told you life is fair?” He laid his spoon gracefully across
            one side of his cup where it teeter-tottered toward equilibrium.</p>
         <p>She attempted the same thing. Her spoon plopped into her cup and a few drops of hot
            coffee splashed onto her arm. She tried again. The spoon tumbled to the table.</p>
         <p>James snickered but remained focused on his trick.</p>
         <p>She flipped her spoon at his cup. Both utensils clattered onto the metal tabletop.</p>
         <p>“Hey.” He looked up, his eyes wide. “What was that for?”</p>
         <p>“Who is the most important person in your life? I knocked your spoon off. You have to
            answer.”</p>
         <p>“Never said I wanted to keep playing your silly game.” He placed the spoon in his cup.
            “You ask me the most fucked-up questions.”</p>
         <p>“Come on.” She guessed the answer but enjoyed watching him squirm. “Who?”</p>
         <p>“Caleb,” he answered. “And not in that way. So that better not be your next brilliant
            inquiry.”</p>
         <p>“What about his mom? You refer to her as Mom also, and I happen to know you haven't been
            officially adopted.”</p>
         <p>His focus shifted back to his cup. “Bonus points for you. I consider her my mom. Happy?”
            A few seconds passed before he lifted his eyes. “Do I get another turn?”</p>
         <p>“Of course.” She fidgeted under the weight of his stare and waited.</p>
         <p>“Honestly, now. How much do you like Cal?”</p>
         <p>Caleb seemed distant at times, and more than a little secretive, but he was sweet and
            treated her decently. “More than any guy I've met,” she said, “why are you so suspicious
            of my intentions?”</p>
         <p>“Distrustful by nature, I guess.” He picked up his cup.</p>
         <p>“How many girls have you slept with?” She fired off another question while he drank.</p>
         <p>“No idea.” He set the cup down and raised his hands in surrender. “Too many to keep
            track of. Not that any are worth remembering.”</p>
         <p>“Why?” His continued compliance amazed her.</p>
         <p>“Why do I sleep with so many chicks?” He waited for her nod. “Because I can.” He
            shrugged. “Do you ask Cal these types of things?”</p>
         <p>“Ha. That was your question, and my answer is, no. I have other things to talk to Caleb
            about. My turn again.” He appeared bemused so she continued. “How many girls has Caleb
            slept with?”</p>
         <p>“Ask him that. Ask me something I can answer.”</p>
         <p>“Why do you always wear shirts with collars and sleeves?”</p>
         <p>“I like my arms covered.”</p>
         <p>“Why?” The word tumbled out before she realized it was a question.</p>
         <p>He stirred his black coffee. “Just do.”</p>
         <p>“You mean you don't wear them to look sexy and drive girls crazy?”</p>
         <p>“You think I look sexy?” He sounded pleased.</p>
         <p>Oh God. Running unfiltered, she practically admitted she thought he was hot. He leaned
            over the table and stared into her eyes. “Do you find me attractive?”</p>
         <p>A faint guitar riff rose from her purse—not her ringtone. The music ended and started
            again.</p>
         <p>“Plan on answering that?” he asked.</p>
         <p>“You want me to answer your phone?”</p>
         <p>His arm brushed hers as he stretched across the table and retrieved her purse from the
            seat. He plopped it in front of her. “By all means.”</p>
         <p>The display read Alexa. Cassie flashed the screen at him, but he only shrugged. She hit
            accept. “Hello.”</p>
         <p>“Who the hell is this?” Alexa demanded.</p>
         <p>Cassie held the phone out. “Your girlfriend sounds mad.”</p>
         <p>“Tell her I don't want to talk to her.” James grinned. “Tell her I'm busy with you.”</p>
         <p>“I can't say that.” She pressed her finger firmly over the mouthpiece and thrust the
            device toward him. “Please.”</p>
         <p>He obliged her by taking it. “What's up? No. You’re wrong.” He made a face into the
            phone. “I'm having an early breakfast with Cassie. Yes, just her and me.”</p>
         <p>The waitress appeared with their food and refilled their water.</p>
         <p>“I have to go now. Catch you later.” He laid the phone down and jabbed his toast into
            his egg yolk. “You're right, she’s pissed. If she knew where I was, she’d show up. She
            seems to be as curious about you as you are about her.”</p>
         <p>“Maybe you shouldn't sleep with girls you don’t have feelings for.”</p>
         <p>“I don't have feelings for any girl.”</p>
         <p>“I'm just saying.” She swallowed her hash browns with a drink of water. “This is an
            assumption, but you might enjoy sex more if you actually liked the person you slept
            with.”</p>
         <p>“It's just sex, angel. I don't want anything else. I'm not capable of anything
            else.”</p>
         <p>“Why do you insist on calling me angel? It’s like you go out of your way to piss people
            off.”</p>
         <p>“I had this dream.” He picked up his bacon with his fingers. “You were holding my hand,
            saving me from something. I knew no matter what, I'd be okay because I’d found my
            guardian angel.”</p>
         <p>For someone who mocked emotional involvement, that was a romantic notion. She stared at
            him. “Really?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, really. I don't remember anything else, so don't ask.”</p>
         <p>“That wasn't a dream.” The memory brought the corner of her mouth up, even though the
            night she’d gone with Caleb to rescue James had been totally messed up.</p>
         <p>Creases appeared in James’ forehead. He set his fork down. “What are you going on
            about?”</p>
         <p>“Hi, James.” A girl, the tips of her hair blue, slid into the booth and snuggled up to
            him. Her dark-haired friend, a girl with dreads plopped next to Cassie. “I thought that
            was you all the way back here.”</p>
         <p>“Hey girls.” The welcome lacked his normal, lecherous quality. He retreated against the
            seat, his gaze still on Cassie. “How's your summer going?”</p>
         <p>“Great,” the one with the blue hair answered. Her eyes flicked to Cassie also.</p>
         <p>James dropped his stare. “This is Caleb’s girlfriend, Cassandra.”</p>
         <p>“Hi,” Cassie said.</p>
         <p>Both girls gave her a curious smile before their attention swung back to James. “I think
            I saw you in Teen Vogue,” said the girl with the dreads, “was it you?”</p>
         <p>Cassie laughed. Teen Vogue. They must be high.</p>
         <p>“Excuse me.” James gave the one beside him clear indication he wanted to exit the booth.
            “Cassie, I’m gonna go pay so we can get out of here.”</p>
         <p>The girls followed him to the cashier. He gave Cassie a tiny shrug from across the room,
            an obvious cue he wished his entourage would disappear.</p>
         <p>She eyeballed him as he approached the table. “Teen Vogue?”</p>
         <p>“It's a school thing. You'll see in the fall.”</p>
         <p>“That sounds fun.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, it's great craic. Let’s go.” He glanced around then reached for her hand.</p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 9</h4>
         <p>The pink eastern sky illumed Caleb’s backyard in predawn dewiness. “Ron’s gone,” Cassie
            noted, surveying the spot where he laid.</p>
         <p>“I noticed.” James held the pool house door open. “Let’s hope he crawled home and not in
            here.”</p>
         <p>She tried to unravel James’ ‘I hope Ron went home’ subtext. But everything about James
            required mental energy and she was exhausted after spending an evening with him. She
            crossed the threshold and plopped onto her favorite chair.</p>
         <p>“Caleb claims you guys can play all these instruments,” she said to break the silence,
            “not just the guitars,”</p>
         <p>“Most of them.”</p>
         <p>“Just like that, huh?”</p>
         <p>“Pretty much. It's how Cal and I met.”</p>
         <p>Eyes closed, she imagined them as little kids performing in black suits and crisp red
            ties. The vision dissolved into them whacking each other with drum sticks.</p>
         <p>“Hey, wake up.”</p>
         <p>She jumped at the sound of James’ voice. Half his shirt buttons were undone. “Don't puss
            out on me yet.”</p>
         <p>“I’m not. Caleb said you can sing. Play me a song.”</p>
         <p>James pressed his lips together but picked up one of the guitars. He sat on the sofa and
            strummed, then stopped to tune the strings. “What else did Caleb say about me?”</p>
         <p>“Just what you said. That you met in some study.”</p>
         <p>Nodding, he retrieved a black guitar pick from the end table’s drawer. Head down, he
            began a song. Melancholy lyrics matched a hunting tempo.</p>
         <p>“Who’s that? It’s pretty,” she asked when the music paused.</p>
         <p>“I wrote it.” A bashful smile crept across his face. “Haven’t even played it for Cal
            yet.”</p>
         <p>He continued, each note filling her with delicious warmth. She leaned forward and a
            bright shade of red colored his cheeks. He laid the guitar down so fast she laughed.</p>
         <p>“You're cute when you blush.”</p>
         <p>“I look daft when I blush.” He shook his hair out and leaned back. “You're falling
            asleep. A swim would wake you up.”</p>
         <p>A yawn slipped from her mouth before she could stifle it. “It's morning. Maybe I want to
            sleep. Besides, I don't have a suit, and I'm not skinny-dipping. Just throwing that out
            there.”</p>
         <p>“Nonsense. If you wanted to sleep, you'd have gone home.” He knelt next to her chair;
            elbows planted on the arm. “What makes you think I would rip off my clothing and skinny
            dip with you? What do you think about me, Cassie?”</p>
         <p>Her breath caught, but she wrinkled her nose. “Well, you're such a man whore, at this
            point, I'm assuming everyone has seen you naked.</p>
         <p>“Shows how much you know. I’ve been with lots of girls, but none of them have seen all
            of me, or touched all of me, for that matter. Understand?” He motioned downward with his
            eyes.</p>
         <p>Her vision followed, to where the material of his jeans covered what he referenced. She
            jerked her head up. “How is that possible?”</p>
         <p>“There are such things as blankets and darkness.” Brows cocked, he added. “Plus, the
            words ‘don't feckin touch me,’ go a long way.”</p>
         <p>“You're kidding, right?” She was warned James was messed up, but he had to be teasing.
            “I would never have sex with a guy who wouldn't let me touch him. That’s insulting.”</p>
         <p>“Girls can touch me, just not in places that are off-limits. Besides, they forget about
            touching me soon enough.” His gaze drifted to her lips.</p>
         <p>“I would still want to touch you…Well, not you,” she sputtered, “whomever.” She rubbed
            her palms together. “Sex is all about touching and exploring. What good is it to be
            physically close to someone, but not let them get close to you. You know, let them
            in?”</p>
         <p>“Oh, they let me in. And, just so you know, sex for a guy is about working out their
            frustrations so you don’t punch somebody. You better get those crazy ideals of love out
            of your head or you're going to get hurt.”</p>
         <p>“I meant letting someone in here.” She placed her hand over his heart, the warmth of his
            skin joined the heat of her fingers.</p>
         <p>His heartbeat pounded, in tune with her own. His breathing hitched. He bit his bottom
            lip, but when she lifted her gaze to meet his, his eyes narrowed. She couldn't read his
            expression.</p>
         <p>She looked away. “So, what about that swim?”</p>
         <p>“You don’t have a suit, remember?” He stood and stretched, his gaze on her,
            calculating.</p>
         <p>She shrugged. If he wanted her in the pool, he needed to figure out how to make it
            happen.</p>
         <p>“I'll tell you what. I'll swim in my cacks if you do,” he spit the offer out, then
            snickered. “I don't want you in my cacks.” He squeezed his eyes shut. “Shite. You know
            what I mean. Swim in your bra and panties. It's like a bathing suit, right?”</p>
         <p>For some reason, the idea seemed plausible.</p>
         <p>“What if Caleb looks out the window?” she said, “he hasn't seen me in my underwear
            yet.”</p>
         <p>“Are you kidding me? He’s out till at least noon.” James unbuttoned the rest of his
            shirt and the garment slipped to the floor. “Besides. It’s just a swim.”</p>
         <p>She had worn bikinis more revealing, but never at sunrise, alone with a guy. One that
            revved her pulse. One that was off-limits.</p>
         <p>“What do you care?” She got out of the chair, her eyes on his waistband. “I already saw
            you in underwear. Besides you’re a guy, you have nothing to hide.”</p>
         <p>“That's rather presumptuous. You don't know anything about me. I may be hiding all sorts
            of stuff.” He undid the top two buttons on his button fly jeans. “At the count of three,
            I'm dropping my drawers.”</p>
         <p>The patch of gray underwear visible through his half-opened fly looked innocuous enough,
            and in her heart, she knew he wouldn’t hurt her.</p>
         <p>“Okay.” She stepped closer.</p>
         <p>In one determined motion, she yanked her shirt off and tossed it on top of his. He had
            the decency to keep his eyes on hers, not on her chest. She undid her pants.</p>
         <p>He blinked. “On the count of three, we ditch the bottoms. One, two—you’re not going to
            bail and leave me lookin an ejit?”</p>
         <p>“Do you trust me?” she asked.</p>
         <p>He nodded. “Three.”</p>
         <p>He stepped out of his pants. She did the same. His amazed expression made any
            embarrassment worth it.</p>
         <p>“Brilliant. I can't believe you did it.” He fiddled with a pen on the end table.</p>
         <p>It may have been an attempt to be polite and not ogle her, but his befuddled awkwardness
            made her feel more exposed than any jokes or lewd comments would have.</p>
         <p>“I'm out of here,” he said, his voice husky. He left the door open and flipped straight
            into the pool.</p>
         <p>She dove off the side into the deep end, then climbed the ladder to dive off the board.
            Surfacing, she swam toward him, but he made a game of not letting her get close.</p>
         <p>“Stay still.” She pulled herself out to sit on the ledge and wrang out her hair. “What
            is wrong with you? I don't want to play tag. I want to talk without having to yell and
            wake everyone up.”</p>
         <p>“We've talked enough, angel,” he said from ten feet away. “You look tired. You should go
            to bed now.”</p>
         <p>“Swimming was your idea.”</p>
         <p>“And now it’s not.” He grimaced. “You might as well not be wearing that bra.”</p>
         <p>No longer embarrassed, she hoisted the straps of her brassiere. He’d hardly glanced at
            her, not that she expected him to. It was clear he saw enough female anatomy.</p>
         <p>With a groan, he slipped under the water. She flagged his attention the next time he
            surfaced. “I’m going.” She pointed to the pool house. “Can I sleep in there?”</p>
         <p>“Why?”</p>
         <p>“No one’s home and I hate sleeping in my house alone. It’s old and scary.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever.” He stared at the sky. “Take the bed. I’ll sleep on the couch.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The track pants James loaned her were where she left them, slung across the chair. She
            pulled a T from the top drawer and laid on top of the comforter, under an oversized knit
            throw.</p>
         <p>In a few hours, her parents would be back, and she wanted to beat them home. Not that
            they would notice her absence, or that she had anything to hide. Other than harmless
            flirting, James clearly wasn’t interested.</p>
         <p>Images of him floated behind her eyes. The way he peered through his hair when he wanted
            to hide, the warmth of his body behind hers. He’d held her hand in the restaurant. It
            may have been more protective than provocative, but hardly the action of someone who
            disliked her so openly the last few weeks.</p>
         <p>The front door opened then shut. Steps faded into the bathroom. She drifted off until
            the creaking floor warned her someone entered the room.</p>
         <p>James stood beside the bed. He wore pajama pants, a towel around his neck.</p>
         <p>“Looking for my pillow.” He backed away.</p>
         <p>Half asleep, she moved over. “Lay beside me. I don't want to be alone.”</p>
         <p>It was a lie, to herself and to him, but she didn’t care. He made her feel safe and she
            was lonely.</p>
         <p>“Angel,” he began, sounding unsure and un-James, “I’ve been behaving bad enough, but
            that’s pushing it.”</p>
         <p>“It's just sleeping.” She closed her eyes. “You stayed with me the other night and
            nothing happened…” Her thoughts unraveled, and she was asleep.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James hovered by the bed. She was mistaken. He’d buggered off within five minutes of her
            falling asleep—before the idea of intimacy short-circuited his system. He spent that
            night on the sofa.</p>
         <p>“Cassie?” he asked, “you awake?” Going into the bedroom had been an asinine move. One he
            had no business doing. Still, he couldn’t help himself.</p>
         <p>“Hmmm.” Her eyelids flickered, then she stilled, her breathing deepened.</p>
         <p>“I don't sleep with chicks. I sleep with chicks,” he said. A futile declaration because
            she was comatose, and the lure was too strong to make himself walk away.</p>
         <p>He crawled in beside her and laid on his back. Horrible scenarios played through his
            head. All of which ended in Caleb hating him and Elizabeth rebuking him. There were no
            outcomes that didn’t spell disaster.</p>
         <p>Cassie twisted into him—a move he hadn’t considered. He automatically adjusted so her
            head lay in the crook of his arm. Jaysus, he was in a bed, cuddling his brother’s
            girlfriend. A tingle shot up his spine. His heart pounded, his stomach flipped and
            before he could stop it, his body melted into the bedding.</p>
         <p>Cassie curled around him, yet he couldn’t feel the weight of her head, the dampness of
            her hair, or the heat of her skin against his ribs. She draped an arm over his chest and
            fisted the blanket, anchoring herself in place.</p>
         <p>“I can't be what you need.” He muttered the words, unsure if audible sound came out.
            You’re dissociating, warned a tiny voice from somewhere in the back of his head. Find
            something to ground yourself. He needed something solid, something to pull him back.</p>
         <p>He inched his hand toward Cassie’s. When he finally held it, he ran his thumb over her
            skin. He could fit her whole hand under his. He concentrated on being mindfully present.
            Next to Cassie. The way his hip sunk into the mattress. The way she curved against him.
            Time trickled by, until he could hear his breaths hungry for oxygen, and feel his heart,
            working hard.</p>
         <p>“Ground yourself,” he said and this time he heard his voice.</p>
         <p>He entwined his fingers with Cassie’s and nestled his cheek against her head. The faint
            hint of green apples lingered under the smell of chlorine, and just like that, he was
            back in his body.</p>
         <p>Sleeping beside someone existed outside of his comfort zone—and always ended in
            disaster. But here he was, one hundred percent present, enjoying Cassie’s slight weight
            and warm presence against his skin.</p>
         <p>He snaked his other arm around her and rubbed gentle circles against her side, a
            soothing repetitive motion.</p>
         <p>Cassie was solid. She could keep him grounded. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 10</h4>
         <p>Caleb didn’t need the orchestra of drummers pounding in his head to tell him it had been
            stupid to drink two nights in a row. But Cassie had been busy, so when James showed up
            with Alexa, a bottle of Absinthe and some underfed, model wannabe he figured, what the
            hell.</p>
         <p>He struggled off the sofa and stumbled over Ronnie, entombed in a blanket, on floor. At
            least the dude wasn't in a puddle of vomit. A definite plus.</p>
         <p>A lone bottle of orange juice sat on the top shelf of the pool house fridge. Caleb
            swallowed two Motrin from his Ziplocked emergency stash, then lit the wrong end of a
            cigarette. According to his reflection in the toaster, this summer might just kill
            him.</p>
         <p>Ronnie shuffled into the kitchen. He stopped under the arch to massage his temples.
            “Shit, Caleb. I hope I look better than you.”</p>
         <p>“I doubt it.” Caleb tossed him the Motrin then slumped into a chair alongside the table.
            “Did those girls leave? Tell me they did.”</p>
         <p>“They’re gone.” Ron swallowed two of the pills waterless. He examined the last pill
            through the clear, plastic bag. “You sure this isn’t James' medication?”</p>
         <p>“Those are in prescription bottles.” Caleb glanced at the closed bedroom door. The last
            thing he needed was for James to overhear them discussing his meds. “My mom won't let
            him keep his medication back here, which is a good thing. I think Alexa’s friend would
            have stolen them.”</p>
         <p>“Speaking of Alexa’s friends.” Ronnie threw him the bag. “Where was Cassie last night? I
            expected you’d be busy with her—since your balls are in her purse.”</p>
         <p>“That’s a stupid euphemism.” Caleb took another drink and debated whether to answer.
            “Her parents got back yesterday. Her dad took her to dinner.”</p>
         <p>“Cool.” Ron grinned. “So…did you screw Veronica?”</p>
         <p>Despite his headache, Caleb laughed. “I wouldn't touch that girl with a barge pole.” It
            was one of James’ crazy expressions. “I don't need the clap.”</p>
         <p>“What the fuck is that?”</p>
         <p>“Some STD. My mom gave us the 'cover your junk or you'll get the clap' lecture as soon
            as I turned fourteen. It was too late for James, though. She missed him by a few days.
            For weeks he was terrified his dick would fall off, but her tactic worked.” The memory
            made him smile. “He always 'covers' now.”</p>
         <p>“Enough.” Ron headed for the door; his face puckered in disgust. “You guys know way too
            much about each other.”</p>
         <p>“You don’t get it because you have sisters.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever, dude,” Ron said from the doorway. “See you on Friday. Remember, pool at
            Smitty’s. And open the window, it smells awful in here.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Caleb took another haul on the cigarette, but it only made him feel worse. Ron was
            right, fresh air would be good. He got to the kitchen window just as Cassie cornered the
            garage.</p>
         <p>“Shit.” He tossed the cigarette in half a glass of stale water.</p>
         <p>Instead of letting herself in, Cassie knocked.</p>
         <p>Juice in hand, Caleb made his way around Ron’s makeshift bed, to the door. He offered
            Cassie a wide smile but failed to move out of her way.</p>
         <p>She peered around him. “Can I come in?”</p>
         <p>“Sure. Sorry.” He stepped aside.</p>
         <p>She stopped in the middle of the living room her expression tight. “What did you guys do
            last night?” A tiny, uncertain laugh punctuated her question.</p>
         <p>“I… ah…” His eyes skirted the room, trying to see what she saw; stacked pizza boxes,
            filled ashtrays, and tipped over cups. It didn’t look good, and the truth sounded worse.
            He set the spilled sugar bowl on the coffee table beside the Absinthe and stared at the
            heap of sugar on the carpet. He failed to consider her response to an obvious party
            without her. She didn’t look impressed.</p>
         <p>The bedroom door opened, and James staggered out. He pulled jeans on but left them
            undone. Gripping the waistband, he scowled at Cassie as he cruised by, en-route to the
            bathroom.</p>
         <p>“What's his problem?” She gazed toward the closed bathroom door for a few beats then
            dropped onto the sofa.</p>
         <p>Caleb shrugged. “Who knows.” Anything could be wrong, or nothing could be wrong. James
            was such an ass when Cassie was around.</p>
         <p>Her unimpressed expression became angry. She looked at him.</p>
         <p>“I can make something up,” he offered.</p>
         <p>The bathroom door opened, and James slumped into the nearest chair. “It's a
            colloquialism.”</p>
         <p>“Huh?” Caleb asked as he plopped onto the far end of the sofa.</p>
         <p>“The balls in her purse thing. It's a colloquialism, not a euphemism. And yes, my junk
            is always covered, mostly thanks to your paranoia. Although, you were right, Mom’s
            lecture scared the crap out of me.”</p>
         <p>Caleb chuckled. “How long have you been awake?”</p>
         <p>“Was I supposed to be sleeping?” A couple of pills lay in James’ open hand. He popped
            them into his mouth before Caleb could tell what they were. “They’re Advil, Cal,” James
            said as he reached for the juice, “relax.</p>
         <p>After a long drink, he set the container on top of the stack of pizza boxes. “You must
            be here to return the testicles.” The question was obviously meant for Cassie, though
            James stared off in the other direction.</p>
         <p>Cassie stuttered out a reply, but James cut her off. “That was a rhetorical statement
            since we are using our SAT words this morning.”</p>
         <p>“Jovial as ever?” Cassie said, just as Caleb was about to warn James to watch it. She
            also looked in the other direction.</p>
         <p>James' gaze swung to her. “That's not an uncommon word.” He appeared amused although his
            tone was derisive.</p>
         <p>“Don’t be an ass.” Caleb shook his head.</p>
         <p>“You could call him a wisenheimer,” Cassie suggested, raising James’ brows.</p>
         <p>Caleb rolled his eyes. “Please don't encourage him.”</p>
         <p>“Encourage who?” Alexa stepped out of the bedroom; her bare legs stuck out from under
            her blanket.</p>
         <p>Caleb started. “You're still here.” Cassie’s eyes had bugged out. He should have
            mentioned the girls, immediately.</p>
         <p>Alexa perched on the arm of James’ chair and smiled. “James insisted I spend the night.”
            She tried to tousle his hair, but he ducked out of her reach.</p>
         <p>“Friends don't let friends drive drunk,” he said.</p>
         <p>“She’s not drunk now,” Caleb pointed out. Cassie had stood up, her face an angry shade
            of red. When Alexa didn’t budge, he leaned forward. “You need to move your car before
            our mom comes out to see who's here.”</p>
         <p>His mother wouldn't check, but he would get the tenth degree about who spent the
            night.</p>
         <p>“I was hoping to take a shower,” Alexa said, her hand on James' shoulder, “join me?”</p>
         <p>“Pass.” There was no bite to his voice, but no interest, either. “Cal's right. You
            should go.”</p>
         <p>She snatched her hand back and jumped up. “Fuck you, James.” She stormed past them and
            slammed the bedroom door.</p>
         <p>The thud echoed through Caleb’s head. He helped himself to the last Motrin.</p>
         <p>Cassie cleared her throat and sat back down. “Does all your special time with that girl
            end so dramatically? That's the second time she’s said, fuck you, James, instead of
            goodbye.”</p>
         <p>“Second time?” Caleb checked James for clarification but only received a shrug.</p>
         <p>A minute later, Alexa emerged. She headed out the door without another word.</p>
         <p>Cassie looked toward the bedroom. “Anyone else in there?”</p>
         <p>“Nope.” James stood and stretched his arms behind his head. “Only one girl in my bed
            last night.”</p>
         <p>“That’s… interesting.” A better word wouldn’t come to Caleb’s mind. “You shared a bed
            with Alexa?”</p>
         <p>Disgust spread across James’ face. “We shared a lot of stuff, but a bed wasn't one of
            them. I contemplated my evening’s mistakes on the floor.”</p>
         <p>Caleb chuckled. “If you feel that way, why do you keep hooking up?” He glanced at
            Cassie, unsure how the conversation sat with her. Her expression read pissed, as if he
            slept with a girl.</p>
         <p>“How detailed do you want the explanation?” James paused in front of the bathroom door.
            “I need to brush my teeth.”</p>
         <p>“Never mind,” Caleb said. He shouldn’t have asked. Anything that came out of James'
            mouth would only make things worse.</p>
         <p>Cassie crossed her arms—then her legs. Hoping to appease her, Caleb smiled. “I’ll shower
            in here today. Wait for me.”</p>
         <p>“Okay.” She gave him a tiny, unenthusiastic nod. “It's not like I have anywhere else to
            go.”</p>

         <p>Caleb knocked on the bathroom door. Permission to enter granted, he stepped inside.
            James looked up from the sink. “Hiding from your girlfriend?”</p>
         <p>“You’re not funny.” Caleb sat on the closed toilet seat. “Shower in the house today? And
            don’t say anything rude to Cassie on your way out. She's mad enough.”</p>
         <p>James dropped his toothbrush into the cup. “I wasn’t planning on being rude. You need to
            mellow out. Seriously. Do you like her that much?”</p>
         <p>Cassie was okay, but she was weirdly madder than she should be, and he didn’t like
            feeling he did something wrong because he hung with other girls. “I do,” he said, “What
            is wrong with everyone today?”</p>
         <p>James stared at him for a second then shook his head. He slipped through the door into
            the living room. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 11</h4>
         <p>Cassie kept her eyes on her Instagram’s poetry page. She wrote under the name, Cassandra
            but considered changing it to, Cassandra Angel. Her latest poem received fifteen
            likes.</p>
         <p>“Have fun last night?” James asked, as he rummaged through a clean basket of folded
            clothing. “You went out with your dad, right?”</p>
         <p>She looked up in surprise. “My dad was distracted,” she said, wanting to forget the
            evening’s events. Especially her parents’ hushed fight that lasted late into the
            morning. “He has a lot on his mind.”</p>
         <p>“I wasn’t lying.” James slung a black t-shirt over his shoulder. “She’s not my
            girlfriend.”</p>
         <p>“She?” Cassie scoffed. “As in Alexa? It's none of my business.” She went back to her
            poetry.</p>
         <p>“I'm clarifying. I told you she wasn't, and I don't want you to think I was spoofing
            you.”</p>
         <p>She stared at her phone, though Instagram blurred before her. Why would James care if
            she pegged him for a liar?</p>
         <p>“See ya,” he said, waiting in the open door. But there was no way in hell she’d look at
            him.</p>
         <p>The click of the latch told her it was safe to lift her eyes.</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>James reappeared much later, balancing two plates of food and a bowl of fruit. How he
            managed to get into the pool house without dropping anything was beyond her. She
            considered helping but Caleb lay, asleep on her arm.</p>
         <p>They tried to make out, but her heart wasn’t in it. She couldn’t get the image of
            blanket-clad Alexa out of her head, and worse, Alexa never went anywhere without her
            posse of friends.</p>
         <p>“Wake up.” James kicked the end of the sofa. “Mom said, you need to eat,” he mimicked
            Elizabeth’s mothering tone.</p>
         <p>The smell of bacon wafted from the plates as James arranged the food on the bistro
            table. He dropped into a chair and smiled wide as he surveyed his work.</p>
         <p>“BLTs,” he confirmed. “I helped make them.</p>
         <p>With a groan, Caleb slowly roused into an upright position. He muted the TV then
            stumbled to the chair opposite James. “Thanks, bro. I’m famished.” He glanced at her.
            “Want a banana?”</p>
         <p>“No thanks.” Her mouth watered for bacon. She massaged her arm and concentrated on
            trying to read Drew Carey’s muted lips. Her stomach growled.</p>
         <p>“Sorry, Cassie,” James apologized from the table. “I didn’t mention you were here. I
            wanted to avoid the cross-examination.”</p>
         <p>“Don’t worry about it.” She drew her knees to her chin and closed her eyes. Last night’s
            lack of sleep didn’t help her mood.</p>
         <p>The sofa jiggled and she opened her eyes to James, perched on the far end. She was about
            to suggest he would be less likely to wear his food if he ate at the table when he
            shoved his plate toward her.</p>
         <p>“Here.” He removed half the sandwich and motioned to the rest with his chin.</p>
         <p>She shot Caleb a look. He should be the one offering her food. His eyebrows pulled
            together—briefly—then he took another bite of his sandwich.</p>
         <p>Cassie pulled the fork out of a potato and stared at it.</p>
         <p>“Don't worry,” James said, “you can't catch what I have from a fork.”</p>
         <p>“Have you been tested since last night?” She fought the desire to wipe the utensil off
            and tasted the salad. It was good. She finished it in a couple of mouthfuls and started
            on the sandwich.</p>
         <p>Caleb pushed his empty plate away. He laced his hands behind his head and tipped the
            chair on its hind legs. The bottom of his green polo hovered above his board shorts,
            exposing an inch of tanned skin. Hot, even in her sour mood.</p>
         <p>“What’s going on today?” he asked, “I’m open to suggestions.”</p>
         <p>James thumped his feet onto the coffee table, hard enough to knock the top pizza box to
            the floor. “Don’t you have school or an assignment to do, Cassandra?” He smiled wide.
            “That shite must take you twice as long.”</p>
         <p>It was a nice reminder, despite sharing his food, James was still an asshole. She glared
            at him.</p>
         <p>“Why do you have to be such a dick?” Caleb said from the table.</p>
         <p>“I’m not being a dick.” James held his hands up. “She’s so busy with you, I’m concerned
            she’s falling behind.”</p>
         <p>“It's Sunday, James.” Cassie set her plate beside the remaining pizza box. “If you
            stayed sober long enough, you’d realize that.”</p>
         <p>Instead of getting mad, James laughed. “Jesus, Cal. Your gash just called me a
            pisshead.”</p>
         <p>“I have no idea what you just said.” She looked to Caleb for help, but he had laid his
            forehead against the table. She picked the pizza box off the floor and tossed it onto
            the sofa. “This place is destroyed. How many girls were here last night? No doubt one
            for each of you.”</p>
         <p>Her voice had taken on the bitchy quality her mother used, and Caleb resembled a deer in
            the headlights when he lifted his head. But she didn’t care. He needed to stop getting
            sucked into James' constant state of debauchery.</p>
         <p>“No one was here but me, Ronnie, and Alexa,” James answered for Caleb.</p>
         <p>She spun to face him. “Like I can believe you.”</p>
         <p>“What’s the big deal.” Caleb waved her off. “Alexa comes to see James, not me.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, relax, angel.” James grinned. “I confess. I got laid last night. I’ll give you a
            play-by-play if it’s your heart's desire.”</p>
         <p>She wanted to erase his wicked grin with her fist. Whose side would Caleb be on if she
            did? She doubted it would be hers.</p>
         <p>James blinked innocently. “Cal didn't do anything wrong—and you don't care who I
            screw—do you?”</p>
         <p>“Of course not,” she said, but her cheeks heated.</p>
         <p>“So.” James smiled. “what’s your effing problem?”</p>
         <p>She didn’t know what her problem was. With no proof of Caleb being unfaithful, she had
            no reason to be this angry, but her thumping pulse told her mad was exactly what she
            was.</p>
         <p>James raised his brows in expectation of an answer, but Caleb narrowed his, like he
            searched for something just out of his line of vision. Self-conscious, she turned her
            back to them. A layer of dust covered the piano. She stepped toward it. “Why don't you
            guys impress me with your supposed musical ability.” They were so arrogant, there was no
            way they could be good at everything.</p>
         <p>A pile of song books sat stacked on the piano’s lid. The top one read, Complete Piano
            Works for Four Hands. She grabbed it sending tiny specks of dust to float in the
            sunlight. A bright blue booklet, Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin slipped out.
            Ominous black notes cluttered the bars, making it appear difficult.</p>
         <p>“I keep hearing you can play anything.” She waved the book at them. “Prove it.”</p>
         <p>Caleb slid his chair back. “You want us to play, Rhapsody?” He rolled his eyes.</p>
         <p>“That piece is written as a duet,” James said, though he barely glanced at it. “But you
            don't need four hands to play it, and I can't stand Gershwin. Knock it out yourself,
            Cal. Show her.”</p>
         <p>James had lost his smug grin and sounded scared. Perfect. She set Rhapsody on the rack.
            “Come on,” she chided, “impress me.”</p>
         <p>“James can do the intro on the clarinet,” Caleb offered. “I’ll play the piano.”</p>
         <p>What was their problem? “I want to hear you play piano. Together.”</p>
         <p>“We don't play together, anymore.” Caleb threw James a glance, then moved toward the
            piano. “I haven't touched the piano since I picked up the guitar.”</p>
         <p>“Liars.” Vindicated, Cassie smiled, but her stomach began to hurt. “You can’t play
            everything. Just like you’re lying about who was here last night.” She wasn’t an idiot.
            They could have had an orgy for all she knew.</p>
         <p>Caleb pointed at her. “You’re going to eat those words.”</p>
         <p>From the sofa, James choked out a strangled laugh. He slouched over, head in his
            hands.</p>
         <p>“Come on.” Caleb lifted the fall and trailed his fingers across the keys. Music filled
            the room as he warmed-up. “Don’t let her call us liars. You can play primo.”</p>
         <p>“What the fuck, Cal?” James shook his head but sat on Caleb’s right. He remained rigid,
            while Caleb’s fingers slid lucidly across the keys.</p>
         <p>Caleb continued to practice. “I miss playing piano with you. You remember how,
            right?”</p>
         <p>Curious, she moved to Caleb’s side and leaned against the wall to face them.</p>
         <p>Caleb bumped James’ shoulder. “Dude. Chill. It’s one song.”</p>
         <p>James lifted his fingers. Sweat glistened on his brow as he played a short sequence. He
            inhaled, puffed out his cheeks, and went over the same notes.</p>
         <p>Cassie leaned closer, elbows resting on the top of the piano. Her gaze met James’ and
            held, until he broke away to stare at Rhapsody’s notes. From his glazed expression, it
            was obvious he saw right through them. A bead of sweat rolled down his cheek.</p>
         <p>“It's okay,” Cassie backpaddled. Nothing about the way James looked was normal. “You can
            stop. I was joking, anyway.”</p>
         <p>“Screw you both,” James said, without looking up.</p>
         <p>He hit a sequence of notes, which must have been the intro because Caleb stopped what he
            was doing and waited, his long fingers poised. Then they were off, in synchronicity,
            each note complimenting the other. Cassie stared open-mouthed. The boastful pianist for
            their church choir back in Kansas didn't come close to sounding like that. Four hands on
            the keyboard made the instrument come alive.</p>
         <p>The music was beautiful and for a few seconds, perfect. Then James pulled his fingers
            off the keys, leaving Caleb’s notes to sputter midair, alone, and sad.</p>
         <p>James sat for a second before slamming the fall, giving Caleb just enough time to move
            his hands.</p>
         <p>“James.” Caleb kept his eyes downward. “I'm sorry.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever.” James’ gaze swung to her. “Hope you impressed your girlfriend.” He scrambled
            off the bench and headed for the door.</p>
         <p>“Wait.” Caleb jumped up. The bench hit the floor. Its hoard of songbooks spewed out from
            under its hinged seat. “Jesus.” Caleb kicked its wooden frame.</p>
         <p>Cassie gaped at the open doorway. James was gone. </p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 12</h4>
         <p>Not ready to face Cassie’s wide-eyed expression, Caleb gathered the booklets and righted
            the bench. He wasn’t supposed to talk to James about the piano, let alone make him play
            it. His job was to keep James’ stress free, and he blew it.</p>
         <p>He retreated to the sofa and scanned through the TV stations.</p>
         <p>“What just happened?” Cassie hadn’t moved from the piano.</p>
         <p>There was nothing he could say that would make sense, not with her limited knowledge of
            James' background. The door swung open, and his mother stepped in. Her sudden appearance
            sent a chill down his spine.</p>
         <p>“What happened back…” She blasted into him but stopped short when her gaze graced
            Cassie.</p>
         <p>“Hi, Mrs. Patterson,” Cassie said.</p>
         <p>Caleb walked to the window. He half expected James to be lurking in the yard, laughing
            at getting him in trouble. But that made little sense. They never ratted each other out,
            even as children.</p>
         <p>He exhaled. “James is in the house?” Great. No harm came from his stupidity. He would
            give the guy some time to cool down, then apologize.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth raised her hands. “He burst into the kitchen like he saw a ghost. I heard him
            go into your room then he just left, without a word.”</p>
         <p>Caleb held up his phone. “Don’t worry. I’ll find him.”</p>
         <p>They were the words his mother expected him to say. What she needed to hear. He slumped
            into the chair. It wouldn’t help to tell her James probably grabbed the stash of money
            from under the mattress and hit the nearest liquor store.</p>
         <p>In an exaggerated manner, he typed, You’re freaking mom out. She's in the pool house.
            Where are you? Not expecting a reply, he set his phone on the end table.</p>
         <p>A beep sounded from his mother’s pocket. She retrieved her phone and studied it before
            reading aloud. ‘I’m okay, don’t worry. See you tomorrow.’</p>
         <p>She narrowed her eyes—at him—then Cassie.</p>
         <p>“I don’t know what happened,” Cassie offered, “they were just playing piano.”</p>
         <p>Caleb sunk farther into the chair. That was the last thing he wanted his mother to find
            out. He expected her to scream at him for his lack of responsibility. Instead, the anger
            on Elizabeth’s face wilted.</p>
         <p>“You were playing the piano. Oh, Caleb. Why?” She covered her chest with both hands.
            “You know that’s a trigger.”</p>
         <p>Her broken-hearted response stung worse than angry words could. “Mom, he's fine. He just
            said so himself.”</p>
         <p>But the fact James texted Elizabeth, instead of him, meant he wasn’t fine.</p>
         <p>His mother teared up. “I hate to think he's out there somewhere—hurting.” She typed
            something as she moved toward the door. “Don't fight with your brother.” Her gaze
            flicked to Cassie. “Over anything.”</p>
         <p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” He threw a sidelong glance at Cassie. Her cheeks were
            pink.</p>
         <p>“It means your brother needs you,” Elizabeth said. She closed the door behind her.</p>
         <p>Cassie’s face grew redder. She shrugged. “James must have mentioned he doesn’t like
            me.”</p>
         <p>That was doubtful. Like James would discuss girls with their mom. Caleb closed his eyes.
            He had no idea what his mother’s deal was, but the evening with Cassie was shot. He had
            to find James—again. And he didn’t need his mom to tell him to.</p>
         <p>He freed himself from the cozy confines of the chair and located his shoes, scattered
            under the kitchen archway.</p>
         <p>“Are you going after him?” Cassie asked. “You might need me. I helped last time.”</p>
         <p>Had he known the shape his friend was in; he would never have brought Cassie along to
            witness it. “Of course, I'm going to find him. And no, you can't come.”</p>
         <p>“You know where he is?”</p>
         <p>“I have a pretty good idea.”</p>
         <p>“At least tell me what's up with the piano drama?”</p>
         <p>Drama. The perfect word for it. “I warned you, nothing is easy when it comes to James.
            I'm leaving now so he can't get too far ahead.”</p>
         <p>She blocked his path.</p>
         <p>“Look, Cassie,” he began; trying to keep everybody happy was becoming more and more
            difficult. “James is already mad at me, and he gets weird around you.”</p>
         <p>She held her ground for a second then headed to the door. “Fine, I’m going. But call if
            you need me.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After she left, Caleb checked his cell. He’d got smart and turned on the location
            sharing on James’ Snap, an App James hardly used and wouldn’t notice. Just as Caleb
            figured, James was in the Fuller Park neighborhood. He went back to the place on South
            Wells.</p>
         <p>Not surprising. The guy always went slumming when something bugged him.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>Just as before, James’ black Mustang sat outside. A throbbing baseline rattled the
            blanket clad window. Caleb approached the building. James had almost an hour on him;
            plenty of time to get into something.</p>
         <p>When he got no reply to his knock, he hammered the door with the side of his fist.
            “James, I know you're in there. Open the door or I'm kicking it in.”</p>
         <p>The music quieted.</p>
         <p>“Are you alone?” James' question came from the other side.</p>
         <p>Caleb pressed his palms against the wood and exhaled. Thank God he hadn’t brought
            Cassie. “It’s just me,” he said.</p>
         <p>The locks clicked, and James opened the door. Dressed only in briefs, he leaned forward
            and looked toward the Charger, like he doubted Caleb had come solo. A gold Saint Michael
            medallion hung from his neck and swung with his movement. The necklace usually hung off
            the mirror over Caleb’s dresser.</p>
         <p>“I told you not to follow me.” James headed to the sofa and plopped amongst a pile of
            pillows and blankets.</p>
         <p>A full bottle of Jack sat on the coffee table, next to a key ring and an ashtray full of
            butts; some with lipstick.</p>
         <p>“Where's that creepy chick?” Caleb asked.</p>
         <p>James laughed. “Traci? She's hardly scary, and she isn't here. I let myself in.”</p>
         <p>“What about her boyfriend?”</p>
         <p>“Ex-boyfriend,” James clarified. “He was an ass. I dealt with him.” He lit a cigarette
            and passed it to Caleb, then lit another one for himself. “He won't be back. Neither
            will Traci. I’m here alone tonight.”</p>
         <p>Caleb pointed to the keychain. “You have a key?” The fact that James failed to mention
            any of this, hurt.</p>
         <p>“This place is in my name.”</p>
         <p>“Your name?” Caleb repeated, shocked. “You're telling me you rent this shitty
            apartment?”</p>
         <p>“Traci and I have this screwed-up agreement—it’s no big deal.”</p>
         <p>That figured. James had this whole other life, but he couldn’t keep his relationship
            with Cassie private. “Must be nice to keep stuff to yourself.”</p>
         <p>“Is there a problem?” James unscrewed the cap off the bottle of Jack.</p>
         <p>Caleb hadn’t come here to fight about his lack of privacy, and James’ traumatic past
            always made his own anger feel unimportant. He focused on the medallion. “You took my
            chain. Why?”</p>
         <p>James looked away. “I was planning to get fucked up tonight. Paralytic fucked up. I
            figured it would protect me. It’s yours and…” He glanced at Caleb. “Do you want me to
            take it off?”</p>
         <p>The sting from James’ secrets faded. “Don't worry about it,” Caleb said, and he meant
            it. He’d done enough damage this evening. “What changed your mind about getting
            toasted?”</p>
         <p>“Your mom sent me a text. She said you guys, you know, loved me, and wanted me to stay
            safe. And I know you weren’t trying to hurt me. You just wanted to play a song.”</p>
         <p>James took a drink of the whiskey. “The whole time I sat at the keyboard, I felt like my
            mom, my real mom, was behind me, waiting to belt me with a board, or worse. She used to
            do that when I messed up. I don’t think she wanted to, but…you know, self-preservation.
            I had to get out of there. Sorry I messed your evening up.”</p>
         <p>The random tidbits of information James let slip from time to time, always knotted
            Caleb’s stomach. Especially when he was the one who should be sorry. Sorry for letting
            Cassie get to him today—and sorry for not saving James sooner. He studied his friend but
            couldn’t vocalize his horrible guilt.</p>
         <p>“Your mom is dead,” he said softly, “she can't hurt you anymore.”</p>
         <p>James nodded, but Caleb recognized the look. He was a million miles away.
            Unreachable.</p>
         <p>“Hey.” Caleb touched his shoulder. “Come back to Earth.”</p>
         <p>James shook his head. “Do you ever wonder what life would be like if we hadn’t had this
            high ability bullshit. When I was a kid nothing mattered but how well I ciphered numbers
            and how fast I learned Seán Ó Riada.” He took another drink, then handed the bottle to
            Caleb. “Shit. You're not giving that back, are you?”</p>
         <p>“Nope. Not in the mood you’re in. And, for the record, if you weren’t who you were, and
            I wasn’t who I was, we would never have met. You wouldn’t have my parents, and I
            wouldn't have a brother.”</p>
         <p>“If I wasn’t who I was, I wouldn’t need your parents.” James stared at his hands. “Maybe
            my real mother would have loved me if I’d been different…able learn faster. Able to help
            her.”</p>
         <p>James reached for the bottle again, but Caleb pulled it back. “I'm serious. You are not
            drinking this. I'll dump it down the drain if I have to.” He screwed the cap on and set
            the bottle on the table. “Who cares about your mom? You have my mom and me. And as long
            as I'm here, nothing bad will happen to you.” He propped his feet on the table.</p>
         <p>James cocked an eyebrow. “You plan on staying?”</p>
         <p>“Yep.” Caleb braced himself for an argument, but if James wanted him gone, he’d have to
            physically remove him. “I know what you're like when you get in these moods and I’ve got
            nothing better to do.”</p>
         <p>“Where's Cassie?”</p>
         <p>“At home.” Caleb stretched out and sighed. “There's got to be someone you like.”</p>
         <p>“Women are the devil, Cal.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, I get all that. But you should try the girlfriend thing. How ‘bout Traci? Do you
            sleep with her? I don’t mean sex. I mean… to feel…” Caleb winced. He’d rather talk about
            screwing girls than cuddling them. “…to feel close to someone.”</p>
         <p>“We've messed around,” James admitted, “but I sleep out here. Besides, I'm not supposed
            to be in a relationship. You’re privy to what my doctor thinks.”</p>
         <p>“Screw what your shrink thinks. You need a girlfriend.”</p>
         <p>“Enough chatter,” James said, his cheeks pink. “I feel like I’m in therapy.”</p>
         <p>“You can keep my medallion,” Caleb said, happy to change the subject.</p>
         <p>“Thanks, Callie.” James lifted the medallion and stared down at it. “You were wearing it
            that day.”</p>
         <p>“What day?”</p>
         <p>“Our last piano class. You were leaning over me and it dangled just above my face. You
            kept yelling my name. I couldn’t answer, but I thought if I kept my eyes on your charm,
            I wouldn't die.”</p>
         <p>Caleb sucked in a breath. “What... what else do you remember,” Caleb asked, unsure if he
            should pursue it. James needed to recall things on his own, Dr. Madison advised. Do not
            prod him.</p>
         <p>James let the charm thump against his chest. “Nothing. Just your voice and this.”</p>
         <p>“Hell, dude. That was seven years ago. I’d have given it to you a long time ago had I
            known you liked it.”</p>
         <p>“No big deal.” James covered his eyes with his forearm. “Do something else with Cassie
            this Friday. You don't need to come to Smitty's with me.”</p>
         <p>“We always go there together. I planned on bringing her.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever you want.” Yawning, James piled the blankets between them, then stretched his
            feet onto the coffee table. “Stay if you want, but I got a headache. I’m gonna crash for
            a bit.”</p>
         <p>There was a tone to James’ voice, Caleb couldn’t read. The mountain of blankets may as
            well be the Rockies. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 13</h4>
         <p>Smitty's turned out to be a derelict billiard hall in a part of the city dissected by
            train tracks. Cassie paused in front of the caged glass door. Inside appeared dark and
            crowded. Not someplace she wanted to be. She craved excitement, not death.</p>
         <p>She wrinkled her nose. “Why are we here?”</p>
         <p>“Relax, angel, It’s just a building.” James teased as he slipped past her to open the
            door. Despite the heat, he slung his leather jacket over his shoulder. He disappeared
            inside, Ron on his heels like an eager puppy.</p>
         <p>“James set this up last week,” Caleb grabbed the door handle. “I need to go keep an eye
            on him, we will be out of here by nine, I promise. We can go see a movie.”</p>
         <p>It was obvious Caleb would leave her on the sidewalk to make sure James was okay. It was
            also obvious there was nothing okay about him. Whatever he was on, left him scattered
            and manic. He may be wittier than ever, but his animated reactions freaked her out. Even
            his shirt was inside out.</p>
         <p>Smoke and spilled beer assaulted her nose as she followed Caleb to the bar that ran down
            the far wall. Caleb pulled out his wallet and motioned over the sea of red felt, for her
            to head to the back where James perched on top of a pool table.</p>
         <p>“You play pool, Cassie?” Ron asked, over the sound of smashing billiard balls.</p>
         <p>“I can guess the answer to that.” James reclined on the table, arms behind his head,
            legs over the side.</p>
         <p>“Hey, kid. Get off the table,” a voice boomed from the bar.</p>
         <p>Caleb appeared with a tray of plastic cups and a pitcher of dark liquid. He kissed her
            on the cheek as he passed, then set the tray on the tall side table where James’ jacket
            hung over the back of the lone stool.</p>
         <p>“It's pop. You think I could get served in this dive. Go figure.” He kicked James'
            dangling feet. “Get off the table. And put your shirt on the right way, for fuck's
            sakes.”</p>
         <p>James jumped down, then sauntered over to the drinks. “Yum, sugar.” With a broad smile,
            he poured himself half a glass and proceeded to take a big gulp. Pop drizzled down his
            chin as he gagged.</p>
         <p>He stared at the glass like it was evil. “This shites horrid. Good thing I brought
            this.” He pulled a large metal flask from his jacket pocket and filled the cup. “Here,
            Callie, for you.”</p>
         <p>Caleb racked the balls into position. He slipped the triangle into its slot then took a
            drink. “Holy fuck, James. Are you trying to get me shitfaced?”</p>
         <p>“Slainte, dude.” James mixed a drink for himself then poured another minus the alcohol.
            “For you.” He absentmindedly motioned in her direction.</p>
         <p>“What about me?” Looking insulted, Ron headed to the table.</p>
         <p>“Do I look like your barman?” James tossed Ron the flask and waited, hand out as Ron
            poured his shot. “Look at that, Cal. Ronnie's capable of doing something without us
            pulling his strings. Ain't that a fret?”</p>
         <p>“Asshole,” Ron mumbled, dropping the flask onto James' palm.</p>
         <p>Caleb pointed the chalked end of the cue at James. “What's with you tonight? Somethings
            going on.”</p>
         <p>“Jaysus, Cal.” James slammed his drink. “Calm your nerves. I’m trying to share a drink
            with me broham, and you think I’m up to no good.”</p>
         <p>Cassie held her breath. Just once she would like to see Caleb get fed up enough with
            James’ antics to leave.</p>
         <p>“Slainte,” Caleb said with a sigh. He raised his glass, drank half, then cheersing
            Ronnie, finished the remainder.</p>
         <p>James handed him another glass. “What are you gawking at, angel?”</p>
         <p>“Your shirt’s inside out.” She reminded him.</p>
         <p>“Go on.” He pointed to the lone chair. “Have a seat.”</p>
         <p>He dropped his cue and yanked his shirt over his head. Despite the breeze from overhead
            fans his body glistened with sweat, making him appear slippery. Not that she wanted to
            touch him. He pulled his shirt on the right way and picked up his stick.</p>
         <p>Being sequestered was fine by her. If Caleb planned to let his friend lead him around,
            she would rather not have anything to do with him. She pulled out her phone.</p>
         <p>Thanks to James, Caleb got drunker by the minute and nine o’clock came and went. A
            dark-haired guy with a scruffy goatee, leaned cross armed against the adjacent pool
            table. He seemed interested in the game but made no effort to approach.</p>
         <p>“I’m going to find the bathroom.” She stood and stretched. Her butt was numb from
            sitting so long.</p>
         <p>“You should go with her, Cal,” James said as she walked away.</p>
         <p>Taking James’ advice, Caleb trailed her around the tables. “Sorry about the movie,” he
            said when they reached the bathroom.</p>
         <p>“Its fine.” She let the bathroom door swing shut.</p>
         <p>When they returned, only Ronnie remained at the table. Caleb frowned. “Where’s
            James,”</p>
         <p>“Don’t know.” Ron lifted his gaze from the array of colored balls scattered across the
            worn felt. “Stop distracting me.”</p>
         <p>“I bet he went out the fire escape.” Caleb looked around. “With that dude. The one
            watching us.”</p>
         <p>Caleb was right; the guy was gone as well. Cassie sat down. James’ jacket no longer
            provided a buffer against the chair’s cool metal slats. Wherever he went, he took his
            coat.</p>
         <p>“Relax.” Ron continued to line up his shot. “He’s probably having a smoke in the alley.
            He's got other friends than you. Right, Cassie?”</p>
         <p>At least Ron was sober enough to deduce a logical conclusion. Even to her ears, Caleb
            sounded paranoid. “I don't see any reason to panic.” She surveyed the pool tables.
            “Except, most of these patrons look like parolees.”</p>
         <p>“You guys don’t understand.” Caleb attempted to stand the cue stick in its required
            slot. “I'm giving him a few more minutes, then I'm going to check on him.”</p>
         <p>Ron rolled his eyes. “I'm surprised you let the guy piss on his own. Although Cassie has
            a point. He is a pretty boy in a bar of convicts.” He took his shot. The cue ball
            connected with the eight ball, which bounced into the side pocket.</p>
         <p>“Great, Caleb.” Ron tossed his stick on the table. “You made me sink the black
            ball.”</p>
         <p>**</p>
         <p>“What do you mean there’s a price change?” James stood in the narrow alley and peered
            down at the short man he knew solely as, Leo.</p>
         <p>“The price is higher for you.” Leo curled his lips in a sneer. “Or maybe I just jump you
            and take your money.”</p>
         <p>Energy rolled under James’ skin, a mixture of drugs and adrenalin. He came for pills not
            a fight, but getting mugged, wasn’t on his bucket list. He widened his stance and curled
            his fingers into fists. “Nobody told me you were a thieving asshole.”</p>
         <p>Leo laughed, then swung. The first punch caught James’ cheek—and woke him up. He avoided
            another throw then at the first opening sent his left into Leo’s jaw, once, twice, the
            second punch hard enough to send Leo staggering backwards. Leo narrowed his eyes, then
            charged forward. For a minute, they grappled. Until a burning sensation sliced through
            James’ gut followed by the bizarre impression of being unzipped.</p>
         <p>Retreating to his haunches, James lowered his gaze. The black handle of a knife
            protruded from his jeans.</p>
         <p>“Jaysus.” He scrambled for a circumcision joke but couldn't brain the words out. “You
            stabbed me.”</p>
         <p>Leo’s open-mouthed stare revealed surprise at his actions. The door behind him swung
            open.</p>
         <p>“James.” Caleb’s voice rippled from another dimension.</p>
         <p>“Fuck off, Cal.” He tugged his shirt as low as it could go. He would rather die in this
            alley than involve Caleb in this. His shirt wasn’t long enough. Perhaps, if he got up
            real slow, and hid the knife’s handle with his arm, he could pull it out in the
            bathroom. He could get Cassie to help him.</p>
         <p>He thought he made it to his feet, but the ground under him sloped, pitching him
            backward. Funny, he didn't remember being on a hill. Off-kilter, he staggered abaft,
            coming to rest against the building. Rough bricks scraped his back as he slid to the
            asphalt, the world blinking around him like an old-time movie.</p>
         <p>A few feet away, Leo stood, flash frame, knees bent, about to bolt. Caleb knocked him
            off his feet.</p>
         <p>James licked his lips, but his sandpaper tongue refused to slide across his skin. Blood
            soaked his pants, spilling out around the solid blackness of the knife’s handle. His
            legs shook as if he were cold, which made no sense because he’d been roasting all
            evening.</p>
         <p>He tried to undo his pants, but his fingers were useless. His hands lay limp against his
            hip bones. The ringing in his ears that started off faint became so loud it blocked out
            all other sounds. His surroundings shifted in and out of clarity.</p>
         <p>A warm hand came down on his. “Stay still.”</p>
         <p>“Mom?” He’d been here before.</p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 14</h4>
         <p>Cassie darted around Caleb as he grappled with the stranger. She sunk to the ground
            beside James and spread his jacket across his chest. “Stay still,” she said, her hand on
            his.</p>
         <p>“I called 911.” Ron squatted across from her, phone in his hand.</p>
         <p>Good thing Ron’s brain worked, calling for assistance hadn’t entered her mind and Caleb
            was no help. He hovered over the attacker; fists clamped on the guy’s jacket.</p>
         <p>The guy kicked, legs flailing, shoes scraping the concrete, an attempt to secure a
            foothold. She hadn’t pegged Caleb as a fighter, but fury darkened his eyes. Knuckles
            bloodied, he raised his fist and pummeled it into the guy’s cheek.</p>
         <p>Cassie tucked her legs against her torso, as the stranger's body thumped onto the
            pavement. He turned toward her; his face bloody but recognizable—the guy hanging around
            their pool table. His eyes were open, but he stayed down. Caleb kicked him in the
            ribs.</p>
         <p>“Jesus, Caleb. Stop.” Ron grabbed Caleb’s arm and pulled him back. “You’re going to kill
            him.”</p>
         <p>“I told you something was up.” Panting, Caleb motioned to a black billfold laying open
            on the pavement. “Check his wallet.”</p>
         <p>The guy remained motionless as Ron rifled through the wallet. He waved a license at
            Caleb. “Leonardo Wallace.”</p>
         <p>The name meant nothing to her. She sandwiched James’ hand between both of hers, trying
            to warm it up. The distant wail of sirens released the tightness around her esophagus
            and relief seeped from her lungs.</p>
         <p>“Never heard of him.” Caleb sunk down beside her, breathing wild. “Fuck, James, you’ve
            got a knife sticking out of you. I don't know how to fix this.” He jerked his head to
            Cassie, his eyes wide. “This guy came to see him.”</p>
         <p>In a frenzied motion, he jumped to his feet and rifled through James’ pockets. Blood
            oozed from around the knife handle.</p>
         <p>“What are you doing?” Ron sounded sick. “You’re going to make him worse.”</p>
         <p>Caleb flipped her James’ wallet, phone, and a pack of cigarettes. “Keep these on you,”
            he instructed. There was blood on the phone, but she dropped all three items into her
            purse.</p>
         <p>“Holy shit. Is he dead?” Ron’s face turned a greenish-yellow, “You never move someone
            with a knife sticking out of them. You probably fucking killed him.”</p>
         <p>“Shut up!” Caleb towered over Ronnie, like he planned to hit him, too.</p>
         <p>“Whoa, Caleb. Hold up. I didn’t do this.” Tossing Leonardo’s wallet onto the ground, Ron
            backed toward the door. “I'm taking off. My dad will kill me if I get in trouble. He's
            trying to become a district judge.” He yanked on the metal handle, but the door had
            locked from the inside.</p>
         <p>“Damn.” He kicked the door, then sprinted to the alley’s far end. He wormed his way
            between the building and a broken metal fence as a white sedan bearing the words Chicago
            Police appeared street-side.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The police exited their car and navigated past debris, down the long alley. Cassie
            squeezed James’ fingers. Where was the ambulance?</p>
         <p>“Everyone stay where you are.” The heavier officer took a few quick pictures then pulled
            out a notepad and pen. He led Caleb a few feet away. “Can you tell me what went on
            here?”</p>
         <p>With a moan, Leonardo rolled over, unfurling his body. His features were swollen and
            twisted. Hair, matted with blood, stuck to his face.</p>
         <p>“Stay where you are, sir.” A lanky blond officer picked up Leonardo’s wallet then knelt
            in front of James. He eyed her over his radio, brows raised. “Area is secure,” he
            informed whoever was on the receiving end. His gaze tipped downward, and he laid two
            fingers against James' neck.</p>
         <p>Not wanting to read what his face might tell her; she studied his nametag. Officer
            McGilvery.</p>
         <p>He lifted his radio. “We have one unconscious male, a knife wound to his lower abdomen,
            weapon in place. And one conscious male, with cuts and contusions, possible internal
            injuries.”</p>
         <p>“Are you injured?” he asked Cassie, as he pulled a card from Leonardo’s wallet.</p>
         <p>She shook her head.</p>
         <p>“Can you ID the boy with the knife wound?” The officer pulled out a note pad.</p>
         <p>She blinked back tears. “James Fitzpatrick.</p>
         <p>The officer’s pen scratched across the paper. “Did you call this in?”</p>
         <p>Unable to find her voice, she shook her head again. The officer’s attention drifted to
            the man on the ground. “Are you Leonardo Wallace?”</p>
         <p>“Yes,” the man muttered.</p>
         <p>The wail of sirens grew, and the front end of an ambulance appeared behind the cruiser.
            Two paramedics wheeled a gurney around the corner, followed by another man.</p>
         <p>“I need your ID and a statement.” Officer McGilvery’s voice remained calm as his gaze
            settled on her. “Just tell me what you saw.”</p>
         <p>Cassie twisted to see Caleb, but couldn’t see past the heavier cop. She handed over her
            license. “We didn’t see anything.”</p>
         <p>“When you say we, who are you referring to?” He handed her ID back then stooping, rifled
            through James’ jacket pockets.</p>
         <p>“Me and Caleb.” She pointed to Caleb. “We were shooting pool. James went outside. When
            he didn't come back, we went looking for him.” She choked back a sob.</p>
         <p>The cop scratched his chin. “What was your friend doing in the alley?”</p>
         <p>“I have no idea.” She hadn’t thought about it, but if drugs were involved, Caleb gave
            her the evidence. She tried not to glance at her purse.</p>
         <p>The paramedics abandoned the gurney and carried what looked like a long surfboard. She
            stumbled back to give them room.</p>
         <p>“Sit down, honey.” The female paramedic touched her arm. “I'm Claire. What's your
            name?”</p>
         <p>“Cassie,” She said, but couldn’t sit. No matter where she looked, she saw the knife
            sticking out of James.</p>
         <p>The paramedics eased James onto the backboard, then applied a neck brace. He remained
            unconscious. A red blotch stained the cement, darker in the center where James’ blood
            seeped into the pavement. Her stomach bubbled up the back of her throat. Turning away,
            she wrapped her arms around herself.</p>
         <p>Leonardo teetered to his feet. “Get away from me.” He lashed out at the medical
            personnel and leered at Caleb, “Better watch your back, asshole.”</p>
         <p>Caleb lunged toward Leonardo. Two more officers appeared in the opening of the alley.
            They ran forward, dodging garbage.</p>
         <p>Cassie stared open-mouthed as Caleb knocked one of the paramedics on his butt and sprang
            toward an unprepared Leonardo. The sucker punch connected. It was the only hit Caleb got
            in before the new officers tackled him.</p>
         <p>“My nose!” Fresh blood oozed between Leonardo’s fingers. “You’re dead.”</p>
         <p>“You better hope my friend isn’t,” Caleb said into the gravel. He struggled to get free
            as the short officer slapped a set of cuffs on his wrists.</p>
         <p>“Who owns the weapon?” Officer McGilvery asked as Leonardo made it to his feet.</p>
         <p>“It’s his knife.” Leonardo pointed to Caleb. “You just saw. He wants to kill me. Let me
            go. I didn’t do anything.”</p>
         <p>Officer McGilvery shook his head. “Are you going to deny that a minute ago, you
            threatened to kill him? I bet your prints are on that knife?”</p>
         <p>Leonardo stared toward the ground as one of the officers searched him. They pulled a
            ziplocked bag of pills from his pants pocket.</p>
         <p>“Take him to the station,” Officer McGilvery said, and the two new officers brushed past
            her, flanking Leonardo.</p>
         <p>“Get off me.” Caleb struggled against the knee in his back. “I can’t see anything.”</p>
         <p>The short cop pulled on Caleb’s hand cuffs. “I’m going to stand you up, search you, and
            walk you to the police car. Understand.”</p>
         <p>“Yes, sir,” Caleb spit the words out. The officer jerked Caleb to his feet just as the
            paramedics walked past, James buckled to the backboard.</p>
         <p>“Fuck.” Caleb’s eyes widened. “You’ve got to unbuckle him.” He pushed backward, into the
            officer, then tried to dart forward. The officer caught the cuffs and forced him against
            the wall.</p>
         <p>“You don’t understand.” Bricks muffled Caleb’s voice. “If he wakes up, tied down, he’ll
            freak. Fuck. Cassie, go with him.”</p>
         <p>She froze. Was that even a possibility?</p>
         <p>“I’ll cooperate.” Caleb’s voice cracked. “But let her ride with my friend. She might
            calm him down. You don’t want him to struggle, right?”</p>
         <p>Officer McGilvery raised his brows, then sighed. “Hold up,” he called to the paramedics.
            You have a passenger.” He shrugged at his partner. “Let her ride in the back.”</p>
         <p>“Go Cassie.” Caleb slumped against the wall. “Stay with him.”</p>
         <p>She reached the end of the alley when Caleb yelled. “Tell them his last name is
            O'Sullivan.”</p>
         <p>Claire held out her hand to help Cassie into the back of the ambulance. “Are you
            eighteen?” she asked before shutting the door.</p>
         <p>Cassie nodded. “I am.”</p>
         <p>“Buckle into the jump seat.” Claire motioned to a small seat attached to the bulkhead.
            The siren sounded and they rolled into Chicago’s traffic. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 15</h4>
         <p>The cramped ambulance offered little space. The male attendant gave her a dirty look.
            “Try to stay out of our way.” His name tag read Larry.</p>
         <p>She skirted James’ feet then crept alongside the stretcher. Eyes downcast she made her
            way to the folded chair Claire called the jump seat. She pulled the seat part down and
            collapsed, glad to be off wobbly legs. With a deep breath, she raised her eyes.</p>
         <p>Remnants of James’ shirt lay mangled on the backboard. Larry sliced James’ jeans,
            cutting the material around the knife’s handle. He paused before removing the scraps of
            fabric to frown at her. She jerked her eyes back to the upper portion of James’
            body.</p>
         <p>An oxygen mask covered most of his face. Two IV needles stuck out of his arm, one
            connected to a saline bag. How much time passed since Ron called 911? It seemed like an
            eternity. God, was she really in the back of an ambulance with James?</p>
         <p>Claire checked James’ restraints before spreading a blanket over his chest. “How are you
            doing?” she asked Cassie.</p>
         <p>“I'm fine.” Pain ricocheted up both her arms and across her shoulders, probably from her
            death grip on the bottom of the chair. Her heart raced like it would give out, but she
            wasn’t on a gurney bleeding, so fine was relative.</p>
         <p>“You forgot to buckle up.”</p>
         <p>Claire pointed to the belt attached to the chair. Clumsy fingers replaced Cassie’s usual
            dexterity as she wrestled with the seatbelt.</p>
         <p>Claire handed her a blanket like the one on James. “Take a few deep breaths. In through
            your nose, out through your mouth.”</p>
         <p>After a couple slow breaths, Cassie allowed her gaze to travel the length of James’
            covered torso to Larry’s hands. The stack of bandages he held around the knife handle
            were crimson.</p>
         <p>“He’ll be okay, right?”</p>
         <p>“We are giving him the best care we can.” Claire picked up the radio. “On route to Mount
            Sinai ER. We have an unconscious male with a knife wound. ETA, under ten minutes. Vitals
            to follow.”</p>
         <p>Cassie shut her eyes. Think about something else. What had Caleb yelled? He wanted her
            to tell them something. A name, but her mind was blank. She opened her eyes. Larry was
            replacing the bandages.</p>
         <p>“He's going to need blood,” he said.</p>
         <p>Claire pressed the talk button. “Brachial pulse 110. It’s rising. Blood pressure,
            ninety-six over seventy.” She laid her hand across James’ ribs and checked her watch.
            “Respiration rate, thirty-one BPM.”</p>
         <p>None of it sounded good and James’ lips blended into his pasty complexion.</p>
         <p>“Patient in shock. Significant blood loss, possibly hypovolemic,” Claire relayed into
            the radio. She adjusted the machine supplying oxygen.</p>
         <p>Larry glanced at Cassie. “Is he on anything?”</p>
         <p>She didn't know what to say. Larry seemed like a total jerk. What if she said something
            incriminating?</p>
         <p>“We aren’t the police.” Claire read her mind. “They’ll run blood work on him at the
            hospital, but it’s important to know what's in his system as soon as possible. It could
            save his life.”</p>
         <p>“Alcohol. Maybe some pills?” Cassie had no idea what he could have taken. She doubted
            Caleb even knew.</p>
         <p>“Does he have any allergies?”</p>
         <p>Cassie raised her palms. She wasn't much help.</p>
         <p>“How old is he?”</p>
         <p>Finally, something she could answer. “Seventeen.”</p>
         <p>Larry clucked as Claire repeated James’ age to the dispatcher. “Check his radial pulse,”
            he said to Claire.</p>
         <p>Claire placed two fingers on James’ wrist. She narrowed her eyes and ran her fingertips
            over his skin. “There’s previous damage to the distal areas of the carpus.”</p>
         <p>The paramedics exchanged glances. “Patient has healed lacerations on his wrist, could be
            considered a suicide concern,” Claire said into the radio.</p>
         <p>Suicide? Caleb never mentioned that.</p>
         <p>James groaned. He jerked against the restraints, rattling the stretcher, and swung his
            free arm so violently he dislodged his IV.</p>
         <p>Cassie brought the blanket to her face and inhaled through. Throwing up wouldn’t
            help.</p>
         <p>“Sir. Calm down. You're in an ambulance.” Larry glanced at Cassie. “What's his
            name?”</p>
         <p>“James.” She pressed her spine flat against the seat.</p>
         <p>James turned toward the sound of her voice, momentarily stilled. Recognition flittered
            behind his blown pupils, then he burst into motion.</p>
         <p>Claire latched onto James’ arm as he wrestled against the straps. “James. Calm down.
            We’re here to help you.” His blanket slipped to the side. “He's strong. I can't secure
            his arm.”</p>
         <p>The paramedics switched places. Larry leaned over James and braced his shoulders.
            “James, you’re losing blood. You need to lie still.”</p>
         <p>“A fháil ar an ag fuck amach dom.” James' muscles clenched as he pushed against the
            straps.</p>
         <p>Claire threw Cassie a look.</p>
         <p>“It's Irish,” Cassie said, “I don't know what it means.” Since it involved the word
            fuck, it couldn't be good.</p>
         <p>“Come here.” Larry motioned to her.</p>
         <p>She unbuckled and took a shaky step forward.</p>
         <p>“Talk to him.” Larry brought her forward. “It's vital he lay still.”</p>
         <p>Cassie sidled up beside the stretcher. “James,” she pleaded. She glanced at Claire.
            “It's the restraints. He doesn’t like them. Can you take them off?”</p>
         <p>“They need to stay on. For his safety—” Claire repositioned her hands, over the bandages
            “—and ours.”</p>
         <p>Cassie touched his arm. “It's me, James.”</p>
         <p>He jerked his head to her; pupils fixed and unblinking. His fingers remained limp as she
            laced hers between them. “You need to lie still.”</p>
         <p>Larry fixed the IV and then took another set of vitals. “Pulse rate, 130. Blood
            pressure, eighty over sixty-eight,” he said into the radio.</p>
         <p>Thanks to biomed she caught the drop in blood pressure. She blinked back tears. “Keep
            looking at me.”</p>
         <p>“Untie me.” The words come out surprisingly clear.</p>
         <p>She frowned. “You’re not tied up. You’re in an ambulance. Pretend it’s a seat belt.”</p>
         <p>“Ask him what he took,” Larry pushed, “he’s on something.”</p>
         <p>“Did you take anything today, other than alcohol?” She didn't expect an answer.</p>
         <p>“We need to know what's in your system,” Claire tried.</p>
         <p>“Fuck you,” James mumbled, “let me out. I'll behave.”</p>
         <p>From the non-reaction of the paramedics, they had been sworn at before. She braced
            herself for an angry tirade from James, but he closed his eyes.</p>
         <p>“Patient is trauma-stripped and combative, with a decreased level of consciousness,”
            Larry said into the radio.</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>The ambulance slowed as it rolled over a small bump. Then, in a flurry of motion, James
            was wheeled from her grasp and pushed through a set of double doors labelled no
            admittance. She swung around hoping to find someone to tell her what to do next and ran
            into a skinny nurse with a clipboard.</p>
         <p>The woman shifted the clipboard and put her hand out. “I’m Nurse Rosetta. I’m looking
            for Cassie.”</p>
         <p>“That’s me,” Cassie said, unable to project her voice to more than a her voice to more
            than a whisper.</p>
         <p>“Are you related to the boy they just brought in with the knife wound?”</p>
         <p>She opened her mouth, but the room blinked in and out of focus. Weak-kneed, she palmed
            the wall for support.</p>
         <p>The nurse grabbed her elbow. “It’s okay, honey. Let’s sit down.”</p>
         <p>Nurse Rosetta led her to an empty waiting room and helped her into a chair. She patted
            Cassie’s knee before disappearing. She returned a minute later, holding a Styrofoam cup
            of water with a bendy straw.</p>
         <p>The water was lukewarm, but the room stopped spinning. Cassie emptied the cup and set it
            on the side table.</p>
         <p>“Feel better?” The nurse sat in the adjacent chair. “What can you tell me about the boy
            they just brought in?”</p>
         <p>Cassie swallowed the lump in her throat and focused on the little pink hearts dancing
            across the nurse’s scrubs. “His name is James Fitzpatrick. He's seventeen.” It was
            ridiculous how little she knew about him.</p>
         <p>“Do you know his next of kin.”</p>
         <p>“I think he's in foster care—or something.” At least she got that impression.</p>
         <p>Nurse Rosetta leaned over her crossed knees. She probably did this hundreds of times per
            week—talking to strangers while their lives careened out of control. “He had no
            identification,” she stated in a kind but matter of fact tone. “Can you give me an
            address and date of birth?”</p>
         <p>Frowning, Cassie shook her head. Clearly, he had a birthday. “Hold on.” She dug James’
            wallet from her purse and searched for his license. It came out, stuck to another card
            marked Permanent Resident, across the top.</p>
         <p>“James Robert Fitzpatrick.” She looked up. “He’ll be eighteen on March fifteenth.”</p>
         <p>Nurse Rosetta touched her arm. “His address should be on there.”</p>
         <p>Cassie read it off but the street was unfamiliar. The nurse wrote it on the form, then
            raised her brows. “And… you're his…girlfriend?”</p>
         <p>Would they let her stay if she wasn’t? She rubbed her lips. “I am.”</p>
         <p>“You’re his girlfriend, but had to read his address from his license?” Nurse Rosetta
            raised her brows.</p>
         <p>Cassie inhaled. “Please, let me stay. I’m eighteen.”</p>
         <p>“Honey, relax.” The nurse smiled. “We have a flexible visitor policy, and the ambulance
            attendant said you were helpful.” She stood. “I'll clear you through security and let
            the attending physician know you’re waiting for news.”</p>
         <p>After she left, Cassie headed to a Keurig, sitting on a low table in the corner. The
            familiar smell of coffee calmed her nerves and she plopped back into the chair. She took
            a tiny sip and stared at the pale blue walls. Where was Caleb now? Both his parents were
            out of the country, for the entire weekend. An eternity.</p>
         <p>She picked up James’ wallet. He banked at Chase and owned a Discover credit card. How he
            managed that, at seventeen, was beyond her. She pulled out a school ID. He looked
            younger but had the same charm about him. Smiling, she put it into her pocket. Next was
            a Medicaid card. That one would go to the nurse. She slid it into her pocket also.</p>
         <p>Along with the cards, she counted almost twelve hundred in cash; a lot of money to carry
            around. The well-worn tip of another card caught her attention. An appointment reminder
            for Dr. R. Madison. M.D., LCP. The card appeared ancient—and was written out to James
            O'Sullivan.</p>
         <p>“Oh!” That’s what she was supposed to tell the doctor. Caleb told her to make sure the
            hospital got the right last name.</p>
         <p>She studied the card. O’Sullivan? Was Fitzpatrick an adopted name? But then how would he
            be in foster care? She couldn’t get the facts straight, or her thoughts. She pocketed
            the card, dropped James’ wallet into her purse, then pulled out her phone. She should
            probably call her mom.</p>
         <p>The call went right to voicemail. “Hey, Mom, it’s me. Spending the night at Allison’s.”
            Her mother would not question the message. Next, she called Caleb, and got his
            voicemail. There was nothing new to report so she hung up. Finally, she left Allison a
            message. Sorry, can’t go shopping tomorrow. If Allie asked why, she would make up an
            excuse. Something inside her refused to gossip about James.</p>
         <p>Cassie didn’t hear the nurse come in and jumped when she spotted her in the doorway. She
            pulled out the cards and extended the Medicaid one as the nurse approached.</p>
         <p>Nurse Rosetta examined the card. “This should help. I ran his name through the Illinois
            Health Information Exchange, and outside of his recent seventeen-year boosters, nothing
            came up.”</p>
         <p>Cassie slipped the card with O’Sullivan into her pocket. Was she supposed to say? Oh
            yeah, I just remembered…he has another last name. They were letting her stay, she didn’t
            want to jeopardize it.</p>
         <p>Nurse Rosetta’s tightened her brows and Cassie’s heart spiked. “He’s okay, right?”</p>
         <p>“He’s out of diagnostic imaging. Your friend’s a lucky guy. The knife had a short blade,
            and due to the trajectory, missed his organs. But it did nick his femoral artery, which
            accounts for the blood loss. He's in surgery now.”</p>
         <p>Poor James. “When can I see him?”</p>
         <p>“First he’ll head to recovery. We’ll transfer him to a unit when he wakes up.” Nurse
            Rosetta paused. “Why don't you refill your cup then come sit down? I would like to talk
            to you.”</p>
         <p>Fresh panic swallowed Cassie. What else could be wrong? Was James paralyzed? Had he lost
            too much blood? She filled her cup and stumbled to the chair.</p>
         <p>“We ran a preliminary toxicology screen. Are you aware of the results?”</p>
         <p>She shook her head.</p>
         <p>“For starters, he tested positive for both amphetamines and benzodiazepines.”</p>
         <p>“What does that mean?”</p>
         <p>“Does he take prescribed medication, like Adderall?”</p>
         <p>Cassie shook her head. “I don't think so. He has sleeping pills.”</p>
         <p>“That explains the benzodiazepine.” Nurse Rosetta scribbled something down. “Adderall
            can trigger a false positive for methamphetamine, but the concern is, it can also point
            to speed or meth usage. Is that a possibility?”</p>
         <p>Cassie stopped listening at meth. Holy crap. Caleb would flip if he heard this. They
            just watched YouTube videos of people tweaking out—and made fun of them.</p>
         <p>“Meth?” she repeated.</p>
         <p>“There was also evidence of marijuana use, and his blood alcohol level was elevated.”
            The nurse wiped her hands on her thighs and sighed. “I'll bring you to his room.
            Hopefully, he will be less aggressive when he wakes up in recovery. We experienced some
            issues in the ER.”</p>
         <p>Drugs and aggressive behavior. It wasn’t just the elevator ride making Cassie’s stomach
            churn. She followed Nurse Rosetta around a few corners, then into a room with two beds
            and a recliner.</p>
         <p>“He’ll be out of it when he gets here and will want to go back to sleep. Keep the lights
            low and don’t expect anything out of him.”</p>
         <p> Exhausted, she sunk into the recliner and pulled her knees to her chest. It seemed like
            no time passed before noise by the door woke her. </p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 16</h4>
         <p>Two male attendants wheeled a gurney carrying a sleeping James into the room. They
            stopped alongside the bed, undid the limb restraints that kept James tethered, and
            shifted him blankets and all, onto the mattress. After raising the bed rails, they
            secured him in the same manner.</p>
         <p>One of them yanked on the straps, then left with the gurney. The other fastened a clear
            bag with a tube, to the other side of the bed.</p>
         <p>James looked pathetic. Cassie made eye contact with the remaining attendant. “Does he
            need to be strapped to the bed?”</p>
         <p>“An incident in the recovery room required restraints.”</p>
         <p>James had been awake and causing problems. Good news—and typical. “So, he'll be okay?”
            she asked.</p>
         <p>“It’s unlikely they’d release him to a room if there was a concern.” The attendant
            adjusted the incline of James' bed and stepped back. “The doctor gave him something to
            calm him down and he should sleep till morning—but here’s the call button if you need
            help. I think it’s safe to say, your friend is not happy to be here.”</p>
         <p>Cassie huffed, “I wouldn’t be happy, either, if I woke up confused and in pain.” She
            flicked the rubber straps fastening him to the bed. “When can these come off?”</p>
         <p>“That’s for the doctors to figure out.” Finished with his job, the attendant headed for
            the door. “A doctor arrives around six to do rounds. In the meantime, the floor nurse
            will be in to check on him.” He turned off the light. “You should get some sleep while
            he's out.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The room held a different vibe with James in it. Cassie yawned and stretched. The empty
            bed invited her. She should have asked for permission to use it.</p>
         <p>She dragged the recliner closer to James’ bed, and plunked down. Her phone read three
            forty-five. Another attempt at calling Caleb proved futile. Not surprisingly. He would
            have called her by now if he could.</p>
         <p>James’ chest rose and fell in a steady rhythm. He seemed peaceful enough. The missing
            utensil made an enormous difference.</p>
         <p>Curiosity got the best of her and she lowered the bed rail. Antiseptic assaulted her
            nose as she lifted the blanket. James had been dressed in a short cotton gown. She
            inched it back. Clean bandages replaced the blood and gore—and covered the entire area.
            A single tube stuck out from under the top of the gauze. It disappeared over the other
            side of the bed.</p>
         <p>She tucked the blanket back in.</p>
         <p>He stirred. “Mam. Tábrón orm!”</p>
         <p>Her breath caught. The frantic pitch to his voice made the back of her neck sweaty. She
            didn’t need Caleb to tell her 'mam' meant 'mom'—or remind her that James’ mother was
            dead. She glanced around half expecting to see a spirit emerging from the room’s dark
            corners.</p>
         <p>James turned toward her, but his eyes were shut. “Callie, watch out!”</p>
         <p>Snapping the rail back in place, she waited, expecting trouble. But his eyes remained
            closed. He continued to mutter but didn’t test his confines. After a couple of minutes,
            she headed to the bathroom. The bright fluorescent fixture spilled light into the other
            room—and would stay on.</p>
         <p>She pulled a blanket off the other bed and hunkered in the recliner. Eventually James’
            babbling, a scrambled mixture of English and Irish, faded as she fell asleep.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A sense of vertigo roused her. Half asleep, she sprang to her feet and stood
            blinking.</p>
         <p>James' bed rocked against her chair. His eyes were open. With clenched fists, he jerked
            his shoulders upward.</p>
         <p>The bed shook and he winced in pain, but it didn’t stop him from trying again.</p>
         <p>“Stop.” She grabbed his hand.</p>
         <p>He gasped as if he didn’t realize someone was there. His head jerked to her, his eyes
            wide—and vacant.</p>
         <p>For the first time, Cassie welcomed the restraints.</p>
         <p>“Hey.” She leaned over him.</p>
         <p>“Cal?” He sounded hopeful even though he stared right at her.</p>
         <p>Cassie shook her head. “It’s me, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>“Angel?” he managed. “Let me out.”</p>
         <p>He recognized her. Thank God. She leaned against the rail. “Do you want me to get the
            nurse?”</p>
         <p>He shook his head and jerked his arm. “Please.”</p>
         <p>“I tried to get them to take these off, but you need a doctor to okay it.” She massaged
            the area around the foam cuff. True to what the paramedics noted, his skin wasn't
            smooth, but the semi-darkness and tattoos concealed all his secrets.</p>
         <p>James pulled away, as far as his restricted mobility allowed. His gutted moan broke her
            heart. The restraints would be easy enough to undo, but she’d probably get thrown out.
            Helpless, she gripped the side bar. James’ cheeks were sleek with sweat, and maybe
            tears.</p>
         <p>“I’ll be right back.” She stepped away. “I promise.”</p>
         <p>Thankfully, the bathroom was equipped with a facecloth. She ran it under water and
            returned to lower James’ bedrail. His eyes tracked the cloth as she held it up. “It’s
            cold,” she said, “It will make you feel better.”</p>
         <p>After wiping his face, she folded the cloth and laid it across his forehead. “It’s
            okay,” she touched his cheek. “I'm here. Close your eyes and go back to sleep.”</p>
         <p>He leaned into her palm; his skin hot. A minute passed before he closed his eyes.</p>
         <p>She waited until his breathing steadied, then straightened her clothes. It was
            five-fifty. Time for coffee and to check if the doctor had arrived.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The nursing station buzzed with activity. “You’re awake.” A male nurse in pale lavender
            scrubs stepped out of the station. “You slept through my floor checks.”</p>
         <p>“You came into the room?”</p>
         <p>“Twice.” He smiled. “I heard you were concerned about the restraints, so I listed James’
            name at the top of the rounds.”</p>
         <p>“Thanks,” Cassie said.</p>
         <p>“Are you planning to stay another night, hun?”</p>
         <p>She hadn’t thought that far ahead, but it hurt her to picture James waking up alone. “If
            I can,” she said.</p>
         <p>“You’ll need to get a visitor’s badge from reception downstairs.”</p>
         <p>Relief flooded her. “I'll do that now.”</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>.</p>
         <p>She’d drunk half her coffee by the time the doctor made his appearance. Dressed
            stylishly under his lab coat, a lime green shirt and dark trousers, the doctor was
            younger than expected.</p>
         <p>He extended his hand. “I’m Dr. Lowell.” He walked around the bed and lifted the blanket.
            “I heard you spent the night. Did he wake up at all?”</p>
         <p>“For about ten minutes,” Cassie replied.</p>
         <p>“Was he aware of his surroundings?”</p>
         <p>“He was scared. He wanted those off.” She pointed to the restraints. “But I don't think
            he knew where he was.” She pulled the appointment card that listed James last name as
            O’Sullivan from her pocket. “Here, before I forget. It has his other name on it.”</p>
         <p>“Other name?” His brows merged as he read the card. “Dr. Madison is a psychiatrist on
            staff here. We should have had this information right away.”</p>
         <p>“I found it this morning.” She met his eyes. “Sorry.”</p>
         <p>The furrows in his forehead deepened. “I’m going to borrow this and make a call. I’ll be
            right back.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie propped her butt against the heating unit that ran under the windows, her back
            against the curtains and sipped her coffee. James seemed too still. As much as she’d
            wanted him to sleep last night, she wanted him to wake up now.</p>
         <p>Not much time passed before Dr. Lowell returned. He strode to the bed and removed the
            restraints. Reflectively, James drew his arms toward his core. His eyelids flickered,
            then blinked open.</p>
         <p>“Do you mind waiting outside?” Doctor Lowell asked her. “I need a moment.”</p>
         <p>Despite not wanting to, she headed to the hall.</p>
         <p>“Everything looks good,” Dr Lowell said, when he joined her. He motioned for her to
            follow. “Your friend is awake and asking for someone named Caleb. I told him you were
            here. He seemed surprised.”</p>
         <p>Great, he didn’t remember waking up last night—or how much she helped him. They stopped
            in front of the nursing station. “I'm standing in for Caleb,” she said.</p>
         <p>Dr. Lowell nodded. “James gave me permission to talk to you. The wound closed nicely,
            unless he does something crazy to aggravate it, should heal well.”</p>
         <p>Cassie snorted. It would never heal, everything James did was crazy.</p>
         <p>“He's on an antibiotic,” the doctor continued, “due to his history, his medications have
            been changed.”</p>
         <p>“His history?”</p>
         <p>Creases reappeared in Dr. Lowell’s forehead. “In case you were unaware, Dr. Madison is
            James’ psychiatrist. He’ll be taking over and will visit later today.”</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>James was fully awake by the time she got back to the room and arguing with a
            white-haired nurse.</p>
         <p>The nurse heaved an exasperated sigh. “No, you can't have more pain medication. Your new
            order is very specific about what you can and cannot have.”</p>
         <p>“Come on, luv…” His gaze caught Cassie in the doorway. He covered his eyes with his
            forearm.</p>
         <p>The nurse turned around. “You must be the girlfriend?”</p>
         <p>Cassie glanced at James, but his arm masked his full expression.</p>
         <p>“How do you deal with him?” The woman held up a box of Kleenex. “He threw this at
            me.”</p>
         <p>“You would be cranky too if someone stuck a knife in you,” Cassie said.</p>
         <p>The corner of James’ mouth lifted.</p>
         <p>The nurse tapped the mattress. “On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the highest,
            where would you rate your pain level?”</p>
         <p>“I had a knife stuck in me. What do you feckin think?”</p>
         <p>“From your attitude, I'll assume you are somewhere around a six to a seven. If your pain
            becomes unmanageable, tell us, and we will see what we can do. She looked at Cassie.
            “Don't let him lie there and suffer.”</p>
         <p>“I’ll try not to.” Like James would be honest with her about how much pain he was in.
            Fat chance.</p>
         <p>The nurse nodded. “Breakfast is on its way. Get something solid into him. Most
            importantly, make sure he stays hydrated.” She pointed to the table where two Styrofoam
            cups had appeared, complete with bendy straws. “I want him to drink both glasses by
            noon.”</p>
         <p>Cassie stifled a laugh. The nurse’s assumption she had any control over James’ behavior
            was hilarious.</p>
         <p>“When we are sure he can hydrate himself, we’ll remove the catheter and the IV. It’s
            important to get him functioning and up and moving.”</p>
         <p>“Jaysus,” James mumbled, both arms now over his face.</p>
         <p>“Sure,” Cassie tried not to smile. It was amusing to watch him squirm for once. “I'll
            get him to have a few bites.”</p>
         <p>“Oh,” the nurse tugged one of James’ arms, “You are moving to a private room this
            afternoon. Doctor’s orders.”</p>
         <p>James buried his eyes in the crook of his remaining elbow. “Good. A fucking upgrade. The
            view from this window sucks.”</p>
         <p>“Behave Mr. Whatever-your-name-is. I’m going to sit you up for breakfast. Tell me if it
            hurts.” The nurse hit a switch and the head of the bed slowly adjusted into a incline.
            “I'll be back later to make sure you're doing what you should.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Cassie, go home,” James said as soon as they were alone. “I don't want you here and
            don’t need your help.”</p>
         <p>The words hurt, but whether he cared to admit it or not, he needed her.</p>
         <p>“Caleb wants me to stay,” she said, “they took him to the police station. He hasn’t
            contacted me yet,” she added before he could ask.</p>
         <p>“Shit.” James lowered his arm and tried to sit, but only made it to his elbows. “He’s
            never been in jail. I’ve got to help him.”</p>
         <p>“You can’t leave.” The thought was laughable. “Your too weak. I’d have to carry you.</p>
         <p>Frustration tied up his features when he realized she was right. He slumped against the
            pillows and glared at her.</p>
         <p>A plump woman rattled a breakfast cart through the door, saving Cassie from further
            wrath. The smell of food filled the room.</p>
         <p>“James Fitzpatrick?” she said.</p>
         <p>“Aye.” James appeared unimpressed.</p>
         <p>The woman located a green tray and checked the tag before bringing it forward. “One
            post-surgery meal, full of fiber.” She set it on the table and clacked the cart out the
            door.</p>
         <p>“Yum.” Cassie inspected the tray. A bowl of oatmeal, peaches on the side, watery
            soft-boiled eggs, and two slices of whole wheat toast. Her stomach growled.</p>
         <p>“Feel free to eat my fiber,” James offered. “I wish people would stop obsessing about my
            bodily functions. At least in front of you.”</p>
         <p>She chuckled. “Come on, James. You heard that nurse. Have a bit of toast and drink some
            water. You must be thirsty.”</p>
         <p>“She can suck me. I’m not thirsty. I feel like puking.”</p>
         <p>Cassie dropped half of the fruit into the oatmeal. She peeked at him over the tray. He
            studied his hands, which shook like crazy. With a grim expression, he balled his fingers
            into a fist.</p>
         <p>Pretending she didn’t notice, she opened a sugar package, poured it into the coffee and
            stirred. “I know you want all those tubes out.”</p>
         <p>“No effing shit. And I'm extra thrilled that you know exactly where all those tubes
            are.” He peered under the blanket. “Bloody hell. Where’s my…” He slid his hand
            underneath.</p>
         <p>Cassie stopped stirring. “What are you doing?” </p>
         <p>“Checking to see if I can pull this out.”</p>
         <p>“What out? Never mind, don't answer that. You're going to damage…something.” She gripped
            his hand from on top of the blanket.</p>
         <p>He snickered. “That's not my hand you're grabbing.”</p>
         <p>Damn him. She jerked away. “Stop. Okay? You’re going to hurt yourself.”</p>
         <p>“Just yanking your chain, angel. That was my hand.” He threw her a small grin. “And I
            already hurt. I could sleep for a week. There is no way that cranky old nurse is taking
            anything out of me. I'd rather you do it.”</p>
         <p>“Have some water.” Cassie grabbed one of waters and tipped the straw in his direction.
            The way his hands shook, he would die of thirst before he reached for the cup in front
            of her.</p>
         <p>He licked his lips. After a few seconds, he opened his mouth and she brought the straw
            to his lips.</p>
         <p>He sucked down more than half the cup. “Toast, please.”</p>
         <p>She fed him the rest of the fruit and a piece of toast. “Okay, James, enough of this
            helplessness. You are capable of feeding yourself. Caleb says when you get like this, it
            is easier to go along with it. But I disagree.”</p>
         <p>“Cal needs something better to do with his mouth than talk about me. I can offer a
            suggestion if you like?”</p>
         <p>She shook her head. “By the way, Doctor Madison is coming to see you this
            afternoon.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah. I figured he’d show.” James pushed the recline button himself. “I'm knackered.
            I’m going to close my eyes, and when I open them, I want you to not be here.”</p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 17</h4>
         <p>After everything she’d been through with him, how could he dismiss her?</p>
         <p>She eyed the other cup of water. Part of her wanted to dump it in his lap and part of
            her wanted to run her hand across his forehead like she did last night. Now that he was
            lucid, he’d never let her near him.</p>
         <p>She stood, calling his bluff, but got no response.</p>
         <p>“Bastard.” She headed out the door, but with no intention of leaving James alone, ended
            up in the lounge at the end of the hall. The room was empty. Exhausted, she dropped onto
            the sofa.</p>
         <p>Why did Caleb have to get arrested? Asking her to stay with James was crazy. But then,
            he had no idea she harbored some sort of misguided affinity for his best friend. Why
            would he? James had been an ass to her since she met him. She didn’t even understand how
            she felt.</p>
         <p>Sun streamed through the window, making the room cozy. She curled her legs under her and
            closed her eyes.</p>
         <p>She opened them an hour later. After throwing cold water on her face in the restroom,
            she steeled herself for a blast from James.</p>
         <p>Someone opened his curtains, yet James slept soundly in the bright room. She sat on a
            chair and pulled out her phone. Hospital, day two, she wrote in her notes, to be
            transferred to her journal later. Summer sun can be undone… blink your eye and you can
            die… It needed work. She looked across to James. Asleep, he appeared okay. Normal.
            Please don’t die. She typed. I like you.</p>
         <p>Right before lunch, a nurse stopped to inform her Dr. Madison would see them shortly. A
            woman with a lunch cart rattled into the room a few minutes later. She placed a tray on
            the table and left. James made a startled noise and jolted awake.</p>
         <p>“You look a bit better,” Cassie noted when his eyes settled on her.</p>
         <p>He groaned. “You're not going to leave, are you?”</p>
         <p>She shook her head.</p>
         <p>James stared at her for a long moment, then extended his hand, tremors on display. “I
            need something to drink.”</p>
         <p>She passed him the Styrofoam cup from the tray. The liquid sloshed as he drank, but he
            finished it all then threw the empty cup toward her.</p>
         <p>“So, you're going to be shitty to me?” She picked the cup off the floor and set it in
            the garbage. “That's your big plan? You really want to sit here all by yourself? Do you
            even know what hospital you're in?”</p>
         <p>“I'm on the adolescent unit at Mount Sinai.”</p>
         <p>“Very good, James.” She mimicked his sarcastic tone. “You asked the nurse where you
            are.”</p>
         <p>“The nurse didn't have to tell me, shite, Cassie. I recognized the skyline.” He jerked
            his thumb toward the windows.</p>
         <p>Not the comeback she expected. With narrowed eyes, she scrutinized him.</p>
         <p>“I spent a lot of time on this ward when I was a kid.” He turned away. “Stop looking at
            me like I’m broken.”</p>
         <p>An older man wearing a brown blazer and carrying a brown leather satchel, swung into the
            room. He rapped the door frame as he entered.</p>
         <p>“James.” He smiled. “I wish I could say I was surprised when I received this call.”</p>
         <p>“Surprise is overrated.” James yawned. “Cassie, this is Dr. Madison, my uh, doctor.”</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison assessed her. Her presence threw him, she could tell.</p>
         <p>“Jaysus, relax.” James waved his hand. “She’s Cal’s girlfriend. He asked her to stay
            with me.”</p>
         <p>“I see.” Dr. Madison pulled a chair to the bed and faced James. “And are you aware of
            where Caleb is right now?”</p>
         <p>“I told him,” Cassie answered for James, “he didn’t see anything.”</p>
         <p>“Cassie,” James rubbed his neck, “sit down.”</p>
         <p>She plopped into the recliner.</p>
         <p>“James if you don’t mind, I’d like to get some information from Cassie.” Despite
            phrasing it as an option, it wasn’t one. Dr. Madison retrieved a bound notepad and pen
            from his satchel. “Tell me what you remember from last night, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>“Christ almighty.” James thumped the back of his head against the pillows as she
            launched into a rundown of the evening’s events.</p>
         <p>“Thanks for the information.” Dr. Madison said when she finished. He looked up from his
            notepad. “I reviewed the police report but wanted to hear it in your terms. James, do
            you agree with everything Cassie just relayed?”</p>
         <p>“I was bleeding to death for most of it, but yeah. If she says it went down that way, it
            went down that way.”</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison scribbled something else. “I hear you tore things up in the emergency room
            last night.”</p>
         <p>“Really?” Cassie leaned forward.</p>
         <p>“Turn your eyes off, angel,” James said, then, after a second added, “relax. I'm
            fine.”</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison flipped to a new page. His brows knit together as his pen scraped the
            paper.</p>
         <p>Groaning, James worked the edge of his blanket. “Stop feckin writing. This is bloody
            bullshit.”</p>
         <p>A few seconds passed before Dr. Madison placed his notes inside his case. He sat back
            and folded his arms. “According to the incident report, you punched one of the ambulance
            personnel as soon as they undid the restraints. Then, in recovery, you tried to get off
            the bed, knocking equipment over, and sent a nurse into a wall. Do you have any
            recollection of this?”</p>
         <p>“No.” James’ cheeks pinkened. “And I don't need to be told what an ass I was.”</p>
         <p>Cassie shifted uneasily “He wouldn’t have been so angry if they hadn’t strapped him
            down.”</p>
         <p>The doctor’s head jerked to her, then to James. “I am truly sorry about that. I gave the
            doctor who called me a piece of my mind, but it wasn't his fault and you're lucky he
            called. After your behavior, they had every reason to keep you restrained.”</p>
         <p>“How did you get called?” James eyed her. “All my stuff says Fitzpatrick.”</p>
         <p>“I was searching through your wallet for an ID.” She dug his wallet out of her purse and
            handed it to him. “Caleb gave it to me before the ambulance got there,” she said in
            response to his puzzled expression. “I have your phone too.”</p>
         <p>He skimmed through the compartments. If he noticed his school ID was missing, he didn't
            say anything.</p>
         <p>“Keep it for now.” He tossed her the wallet then eyed his doctor. “Now. Where the hell
            is Cal?”</p>
         <p>The man planted his hand on James’ shoulder. “The police are holding him.”</p>
         <p>The news brought Cassie to her feet. She half expected that but hadn’t planned on
            dropping it on James anytime soon. She stepped toward the bed.</p>
         <p>“Holding him?” James struggled to free himself from his doctor’s grip. Panting, he sank
            onto the mattress. “This feckin sucks. Cal was protecting me.”</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison sighed. “Caleb was drunk in a public place and interfered with an
            investigation. As a minor, he needs to be released into the custody of a parent.”</p>
         <p>“Where’s Elizabeth?”</p>
         <p>“She’s gone 'till Sunday, James,” Cassie said, “the weekend getaway. You were there when
            Caleb told me.” She seriously wondered about James’ memory.</p>
         <p>“Sunday.” He scowled. “Cal could be getting the shit kicked out of him right about now.
            Because of me.”</p>
         <p>Without thinking, Cassie placed her hand over his. He didn’t shake her off.</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison cleared his throat. “I spoke with the arresting officer and explained the
            dynamic to him. Caleb will be released to his mother, and have to pay a fine. She’s on
            her way back.” He leaned forward. “Caleb isn’t my concern. I have more pressing matters
            to discuss with you.”</p>
         <p>“Let me guess.” Bitterness dripped from James’ voice. “They ran a toxicology report.</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison nodded. “Cassie, can we have a moment?” His gaze rested on their linked
            hands, his eyes sad.</p>
         <p>James pulled his hand away.</p>
         <p>She crossed the room to the windows. If they wanted more privacy, one of them would have
            to ask her to leave. Catching every fifth word, she surveyed the outside. Life on the
            ground seemed far away. Behind her, James swore, and their voices grew softer.</p>
         <p>“Cassie.” Dr. Madison addressed her from the open doorway. “Can I speak with you
            privately?”</p>
         <p>“Leave her alone,” James said, “she’s got nothing to do with this.”</p>
         <p>Cassie waited, halfway to the door, for James to say something else.</p>
         <p>“Jaysus.” He motioned for her to follow. “Go on.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“He seems a bit protective of you.” Dr. Madison said as she stepped into the hallway.
            “Can I offer you some advice?”</p>
         <p>“Okay.” she said, though she would rather not hear it. It was easy to tell he didn’t
            approve of her being there.</p>
         <p>“James has a lot on his plate and isn’t handling things in an appropriate manner.”
            Doctor Madison smiled, but his words were firm. “I suggest you give him some space.”</p>

         <h4>Chapter 18</h4>
         <p>“Are you going to tell me what really happened last night?” James asked as soon as she
            re-entered the room.</p>
         <p>Cassie sank into the chair. “You heard what I told your doctor.”</p>
         <p>“I'm assuming you left some details out.”</p>
         <p>“Some,” she admitted.</p>
         <p>“I know I got shanked in an alley, and I know why. What I need you to tell me is what
            happened before—and after.”</p>
         <p>She frowned. “Did you know that guy?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, I knew him. But you don't, and neither does Caleb, so it's not important.”</p>
         <p>“Is he crazy? What made him stab you?”</p>
         <p>“Let it go.” James’ voice stayed even. “Just tell me what you saw. We were shooting
            pool, right?”</p>
         <p>“You had a flask of something. You kept filling Caleb’s cup—and he kept drinking.” James
            paled and she paused. Inflicting guilt wasn’t her intention.</p>
         <p>“Go on,” he encouraged, “give me the facts.”</p>
         <p>“Caleb insisted you snuck out the side door, so after a few minutes we followed.” It was
            a descriptive timeline, and where she wished to stop.</p>
         <p>“What did you guys see?”</p>
         <p>“You were kneeling on the ground, over that guy. You tried to stand up…but stumbled
            backward. Your clothes were bloody… a knife stuck out of you.”</p>
         <p>“That’s all?” He watched her closely.</p>
         <p>“You passed out. Went into shock or something.”</p>
         <p>“Nothing else?”</p>
         <p>She frowned. What else was there? “I think Caleb went temporarily insane. One minute he
            stood beside me, the next he attacked that guy. Ron had to pull him off.”</p>
         <p>“Where were you during all this?”</p>
         <p>“With you. I held your hand until help arrived.” She leaned back in the chair.</p>
         <p>“You held my hand?” His voice tightened.</p>
         <p>“Well, Ron took off, and Caleb was crying—”</p>
         <p>“Shite. Cal was crying?”</p>
         <p>“He thought you were dead, James. You know how he gets when someone messes with you. He
            wanted to kill that guy. I'm not kidding. The police had him on the ground in
            handcuffs.”</p>
         <p>“No way.” He stared past her.</p>
         <p>“When the paramedics strapped you down, Caleb freaked out all over again, begging them
            to unbuckle you.”</p>
         <p>“They took Cal away,” James’ voice was dark, “shackled.”</p>
         <p>“I don't know what happened after that. I left with you.”</p>
         <p>“You rode with me?” His eyes snapped to her. “Shotgun, right?”</p>
         <p>“They let me sit in the back.”</p>
         <p>“You’re spoofing me? They never let people in the back.”</p>
         <p>She sighed. “You really can’t remember any of this?”</p>
         <p>He shook his head.</p>
         <p>“Do you remember waking up last night and talking to me?”</p>
         <p>He shot her a tortured look. “Sorry if I was more of an ass to you than normal.”
            Reclining the bed, he closed his eyes. “I need some time—alone—to process this. Can you
            disappear for a bit?”</p>
         <p>Disappear? What did that mean? She glared at him.</p>
         <p>He opened his eyes. “Mellow out. You can come back. Just give me an hour. Go get some
            air or something.”</p>
         <p>She jerked herself out of the chair. Who did he think he was? Come, go, sit, stay. Was
            she a puppy? She headed for the door.</p>
         <p>“Hey.”</p>
         <p>She stopped. Crap. She was a puppy.</p>
         <p>“Come back here for a minute.”</p>
         <p>She stomped toward him. He could have his say, then she would give him a piece of her
            mind.</p>
         <p>James examined his nails. When he lifted his head, he was no longer scowling. Instead,
            he gave her a bashful smile, catching her more off guard than cursing her out ever
            could.</p>
         <p>He reached for her hand. “I'm not used to saying this to girls, but I want you to stay.
            Just let me sleep for a bit without feeling like I'm being watched.” He brought her hand
            to his lips. “For the record, I've never kissed a girl’s hand, either.”</p>
         <p>Heat shot up her arm and exploded in her stomach. She jerked her hand away.</p>
         <p>He laughed, then winced. “You should see your expression. Good thing I didn't kiss your
            cheek.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever.” She backed away until her fingers touched the door frame. “I’m going home
            for a bit. Keep your lips to yourself or I won't come back.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>Despite it being late afternoon, Cassie’s mother lay asleep on the sofa. Cassie crept up
            the stairs to her room, then dumped the contents of her backpack onto her bed. She
            proceeded to the pool house with the empty sac. To her relief she found the pool house
            door, unlocked.</p>
         <p>What might James need? She stuffed a pair of jeans, a couple of T-shirts, and some
            underwear—all waistbands she had memorized—into her backpack, along with a new
            toothbrush. Confused by the bottles of aftershave and deodorant, she grabbed the only
            one in a plastic container.</p>
         <p>She left his cigarettes on the table and called a taxi.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James was still asleep when she returned. The drapes were drawn, and supper waited on
            the bedside table.</p>
         <p>The older nurse stuck her head in. “His room is ready,” she informed Cassie, “We’ll get
            everything unhooked so he can ride in a chair for the transition.”</p>
         <p>“Right now?” He wasn’t going to like this.</p>
         <p>The nurse shook her head. “I'll pop back in. It's probably better if you don't mention
            this. I think it will go easier if he doesn’t have time to stress about it.”</p>
         <p>Cassie rolled her eyes. “Why does everyone tiptoe around him?”</p>
         <p>The nurse checked her watch. “It’s been a long day. It’ll be easier on both of us if he
            is cooperative, and I've heard that isn’t one of his finer points.”</p>
         <p>Cassie curled back into the chair. The nurse wasn't being fair. Cooperation may not have
            been one of James’ better traits, but he was loyal to Caleb to a fault, had this amazing
            way of seeing through people, and wasn't scared to tell the truth. Plus, she trusted
            him. They were solid traits. Appealing ones.</p>
         <p>“Cal!” James bolted upright, his eyes wild. He covered his stitches. “Damn.”</p>
         <p>“Caleb’s not here.” Cassie hovered over him and his features relaxed. “Are you
            okay?”</p>
         <p>“You came back. Did I yell out loud?”</p>
         <p>He allowed her to ease him back into a reclined position. “You yelled for Caleb,
            again.”</p>
         <p>“Again?”</p>
         <p>Cassie nodded, but chose not to tell him how many times he cried out for Caleb, or that
            he called for his mam. Regardless of whom he wanted, hearing him beg, hurt.</p>
         <p>His gaze swept sleepily over his supper tray. “What time is it, anyway?”</p>
         <p>“Late afternoon.” She removed the lid from the plate to expose another bland meal. “By
            the way, a nurse stopped by. She wants to remove the tubes so you can go to your new
            room.”</p>
         <p>He immediately appeared more alert.</p>
         <p>“I wasn’t supposed to tell you. She thought it would be easier if you didn’t have time
            to stress about it. But you're a big boy. I know you can handle a simple medical
            procedure.”</p>
         <p>She may not be a psychiatrist but figured if she expected him to be strong, he would be.
            Pride would overrule his fear.</p>
         <p>His jaw twitched. “You think you know a lot about me.”</p>
         <p>“Maybe I do.” The last twenty hours had been a crash course. “You don’t want to be
            messed with and freak out when anyone comes too close.” He glared at her, but she
            continued, “The best way to get left alone in the hospital is to allow people do their
            job.”</p>
         <p>His mouth twisted, but he remained silent. Either she was right, or he didn't have the
            stamina to argue with her.</p>
         <p>Both worked.</p>
         <p>As promised, the nurse returned within the hour. She wheeled a cart bearing medical
            supplies and stopped at the foot of James bed. He made a strangled sound that ended in a
            cough.</p>
         <p>She frowned at Cassie. “You told him.”</p>
         <p>Unable to deny the obvious, Cassie shrugged.</p>
         <p>With a sigh, the nurse removed a small metal basin from the cart. She addressed James.
            “I’m going to remove your catheter and IV. Neither are difficult procedures—if you
            cooperate. You can request a male nurse, but you will have to wait.”</p>
         <p>James’ shook his head. “Take the effing thing out now.”</p>
         <p>The nurse turned to Cassie. “This will only take a minute. Can you step into the hall,
            please?”</p>
         <p>“No,” James said as Cassie got up to leave, his panic unmistakable, “stay here.”</p>
         <p>“You want me to stay?” She stammered the words and would rather leave, but he appeared
            terrified.</p>
         <p>He chewed his bottom lip, then nodded. “Turn your chair to face me.”</p>
         <p>The nurse washed her hands and slipped on a pair of blue gloves. She didn’t seem to care
            who was in the room. “You’ll feel my hand and some tugging,” she said, once Cassie got
            situated.</p>
         <p>James paled. How could someone who got into so many fights, fear a simple medical
            procedure? Cassie planted her elbows on the bed and leaned forward. James’ had the
            longest lashes.</p>
         <p>He caught her eyes. A tiny smirk ghosted his lips. She kept his gaze and tried not to
            think about what was happening.</p>
         <p>“Shite.” James glanced around her. His eyebrows raised, then knotted. “She could at
            least be hot.”</p>
         <p>Cassie held her breath. If she were the nurse, she would rip out that tube extra
            fast.</p>
         <p>“I was hot once, if that helps.” The nurse didn’t sound upset. “Use your
            imagination.”</p>
         <p>James shifted in obvious discomfort.</p>
         <p>Cassie chuckled. “You’re blushing.”</p>
         <p>“All done.” The nurse moved away from the bed. “Didn’t spill a drop.”</p>
         <p>“Christ,” James mumbled, the pink in his cheeks darker.</p>
         <p>Cassie looked behind her. The blankets were heaped over his groin, his legs bare. Her
            cheeks heated to match his.</p>
         <p>The nurse dumped everything into a bag. She peeled her gloves off and tucked the blanket
            in. “Now the IV.”</p>
         <p>A few seconds later, he was free of all the equipment.</p>
         <p>He rubbed the puncture mark. “That hurt.”</p>
         <p>“Really?” Relieved it was over, Cassie smiled. “That's the first time I've heard you say
            ouch, and I know of a few occasions when you should have.”</p>
         <p>“Was I drunk?”</p>
         <p>The smile died on her lips. She’d already seen him demolish himself more than she wanted
            to—in a lifetime. How did Caleb cope?</p>
         <p>“Speaking of being drunk. Are you still experiencing withdrawal symptoms?” The nurse
            waited for a reply.</p>
         <p>He shot Cassie a sideways glance. “None of your fecken business. You’re not my
            doctor.”</p>
         <p>“No, I am not.” The nurse let out a heavy sigh. “But I pity him.”</p>

         <h4>Chapter 19</h4>
         <p>Cassie waited in the doorway as the unit aid settled James into his room.</p>
         <p>“I wish everyone would disappear and leave us alone,” James said as the aid finished.
            When the door shut, he pulled a cigarette pack from under his gown.</p>
         <p>“Where did you get those?” She grinned, more baffled than angry. “You can’t smoke in
            here.”</p>
         <p>“Are they gonna toss me out?” He pulled matches from the pack, then blew smoke at her.
            “Do I amuse you? You remind me of Cal. Always laughing at me.”</p>
         <p>“And what would Caleb say about you smoking in here?”</p>
         <p>“Cal would check to make sure the oxygen port was closed, then say, ‘give me a drag’. He
            motioned toward the door. “There’s a ton of games in the lounge. Why don't you go pick
            something out for us?”</p>
         <p>If he managed to smuggle cigarettes, what else could he produce from under his gown? Not
            that she was foolish enough to ask such a loaded question. “It's late.” She eyed his
            smock. “You really want to play a game?”</p>
         <p>“Holy shit, angel. Chill. I don't have heroin stashed under my blanket. Lift it up and
            check me out if you don't believe me.” One side of his mouth twisted into a grin.
            “You’re as bad as your boyfriend. I'm not trying to kill myself.”</p>
         <p>“Could have fooled me.”</p>
         <p>He popped the lid off the Styrofoam cups and dropped his cigarette into his water.
            “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
         <p>“You don’t seem to like yourself very much.” She didn’t want to get into an emotionally
            laden conversation this late in the evening. Not when his face told her he was in more
            pain than he let on.</p>
         <p>James rubbed his chin. “What makes you say that?”</p>
         <p>“You have no respect for your body.”</p>
         <p>“Did that come from Caleb?”</p>
         <p>“No. But I know he hates watching you destroy yourself. He’s so worried about you, he
            has a hard time living his own life.” She stopped. That broached saying too much.</p>
         <p>“Nonsense.” James shook his head. “Cal worries too much. I can take care of myself.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, I can see that.” Cassie motioned to their surroundings. “You need to lighten up
            on Caleb. He cares about what happens to you.”</p>
         <p>Emotion swirled behind James’ features. “Look at you,” he finally got out, his voice
            thick, “all protective of my best friend.”</p>
         <p>“Never mind.” She looked at the ceiling. “I'll go find a game.” </p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>As James predicted, a plethora of board games waited in the lobby. In a rush to get
            back, she grabbed cards and a crib board off the top shelf, her grandma’s favorite
            game.</p>
         <p>“Hope you know how to play cribbage,” she said as she entered the room. She stopped
            short. James extended his hand toward her, fingers clenched in a tight fist.</p>
         <p>“Take these.” He uncurled his fingers. Two pills lay cradled against his palm. “Now,” he
            said louder when she failed to move. “Flush them.”</p>
         <p>She dropped the crib board and cards onto the table and plucked up the pills. “What are
            they?”</p>
         <p>“Something I’m not swallowing.” He retreated against his pillow and closed his eyes.
            “Get rid of them before I change my mind.”</p>
         <p>“They’re gone,” she said when she returned to the room. She sat in the chair and folded
            her hands in her lap. “Why didn’t you take them?”</p>
         <p>“Because I’m not delusional enough to think you wouldn’t notice.” He gave her a rueful
            grin. “Don't tell Caleb.”</p>
         <p>“About the pills? Or your toxicology report?” Or something totally different?</p>
         <p>“He'll find out about the report sooner than later.” James ran his hand through his
            hair, leaving it a mess of swoops and angles. “Don’t tell him about the pills, about the
            catheter…” his voice trailed off. “Or about me wanting you to stay.” He studied her.
            “This is Vegas. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?”</p>
         <p>She nodded. He looked so tired—she would sell her soul if it would make him feel
            better.</p>
         <p>“Swing the table over the bed.” He blew out a puff of air and squirmed into a sitting
            position. “Are we gonna play cribbage or what? I’m sure I’ve played every game
            here.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Crib proved to be beyond James' capabilities, and more stressful than Cassie imagined.
            His shaking hands made it impossible for him to manipulate the pegs. Even holding his
            cards required too much dexterity. He rested his arms on his thighs, cards so low Cassie
            could read them.</p>
         <p>Except for two bright dots of color on either cheek, his pallor took on a grayish tinge.
            Sweat plastered his hospital gown to his chest. He plucked at the material, pulling it
            away from his skin. She bet his pain level neared ten on that pain management scale.</p>
         <p>“Do you want me to get a nurse?” she asked when she could no longer stand to watch him
            suffer.</p>
         <p>“Don’t bother. They won’t give me what I want.” He laid his cards down. “Move me eight
            points.”</p>
         <p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
         <p>He nodded slightly and tossed his crib cards on top of the others. “Six points in my
            cribbage. That’s fourteen points total. Come on, Cassie, advance my peg.”</p>
         <p>She moved his peg, then reached around him for the buzzer. “I’m getting a nurse.”</p>
         <p>A woman appeared almost instantaneously, tendrils of black hair falling out of a messy
            bun. She carried a tray that held another Styrofoam cup and a small container.</p>
         <p>Cassie got up. “He needs something for pain.”</p>
         <p>“I was on my way here.” The woman checked James’ wristband before setting the tray on
            the table. “I’ve brought tramadol.”</p>
         <p>James stared into the container holding the pill. “You’re giving me one Tramadol? I got
            feckin stabbed.” He scowled at the girl. “I want Dilaudid. In my feckin arm.”</p>
         <p>The woman wilted. “I can only deliver what they give me.”</p>
         <p>He stared at her tag. “Jaysus, an LPN. You're useless. Tell the nurse practitioner to
            write me a new prescription. And don’t tell me there’s no NP on the floor.” He waved her
            off.</p>
         <p>She stayed where she was, mouth open.</p>
         <p>“Do you have a problem understanding English?”</p>
         <p>“James!” Cassie covered her mouth. “It’s not her fault.”</p>
         <p>“It is her fault. She wasn’t bright enough to go to med school.” He glared at the girl
            as she retreated from the room, then directed his glower at Cassie. “Deal.”</p>
         <p>With a deep breath, Cassie counted her points then shuffled the cards. “You need to take
            the medication they give you.”</p>
         <p>“What do you know about meds?” he scoffed. “Or pain?” He reached for the water. The
            bottom of the cup caught the edge of the table. The lid dislodged and water spilled into
            his lap, soaking his blanket.</p>
         <p>“Bloody hell.” He shoved the blanket against the table. The crib pegs teetered. Three of
            them fell over and rolled onto the floor. “Fuck!”</p>
         <p>Cassie scanned the door, expecting someone to burst through.</p>
         <p>“I can't stand this. I'm completely effing useless.” He threw the wooden crib board
            across the room. It whizzed past her head and smacked the wall.</p>
         <p>After a second, she stepped forward. “I'll get a nurse to change the bedding.” She
            pulled the wet blanket off his legs. “You’re soaked.”</p>
         <p>He swung his legs over the bed, his features pinched. “Bring the sheets yourself. I
            don't want to see anyone.”</p>
         <p>Despite his outburst, she wasn’t scared. He was mad at himself, not her. The nursing
            station was busy, so she walked the hall in search of bedding. A door labeled clean
            supply had been left open.</p>
         <p>“I thought you’d left,” James said when she returned with a stack of linens.</p>
         <p>He had abandoned his bed for the chair. His pillow lay across his lap, his gown a heap
            on the floor. He resembled a little child in a timeout.</p>
         <p>The thought made her smile. “Are you naked?”</p>
         <p>“Do bandages count as clothing? My gown’s wet. You said so yourself.” Tight-lipped, he
            stared toward the window.</p>
         <p>“You’re shivering.” Cassie inched closer, then stopped. He was naked. What did she
            intend to do? Hug him?</p>
         <p>He raised his hand. “Spare me the pity. I'm not a complete moron. I realize I brought
            this on myself.”</p>
         <p>“Here.” She handed him the gown off the top of the linens. “I found pajama bottoms too.”
            She held them up. They were triple his size.</p>
         <p>James scrutinized them, nose wrinkled. “Gee, thanks, Cassie. You brought me clown
            pants.” He tactically shifted the pillow and stood. But instead of grabbing the pajamas,
            his fingers encircled her wrist. His eyes locked on hers. “Really. Thanks.”</p>
         <p>“You’re welcome.” Her gaze slipped, over the pillow, to his bare feet.</p>
         <p>His fingers lingered then he slid his hand down, to relieve her of the pants. He pulled
            them easily from her grip.</p>
         <p>She dropped the linens on the bed and unfolded the fitted sheet. James slipped into the
            bottoms, behind her, then slinked into the bathroom. He returned as she straightened the
            creases from the final blanket.</p>
         <p>“I wouldn’t have bothered with the top,” he said, standing beside her, “but I've been
            feeling kinda naked lately. I guess hospital green is better than jumpsuit orange.”</p>
         <p>Cassie lifted the corner of the blanket and waited for him to climb in.</p>
         <p>His forehead wrinkled. “Orange. Get it? The ones you wear in jail.”</p>
         <p>“Oh, hospital humor. Ha.” She tucked him in. “I get it.”</p>
         <p>He ran his hand over the blanket. “Not a bad job.”</p>
         <p>“I know how to make a bed, James.” She glanced at him. His eyes were greener than usual,
            the color of Kansas grass. There wasn’t enough grass in Chicago. “You seem less
            angry.”</p>
         <p>He grunted. “I just pissed on my own. That made me happy.”</p>
         <p>For some reason his blunt honesty made her laugh. “What do you want to do?”</p>
         <p>“I want you to look at me.”</p>
         <p>She swung her gaze back to his, subjecting herself to his cocked head examination.
            Unable to maintain eye contact, she turned away again.</p>
         <p>Chuckling, he adjusted his pillow. “Tell me a story. Something about you. Who are you,
            angel? How did you land in my doorway?”</p>
         <p>“Uh.” Did he really want a story? She plopped into the big armchair across the room.</p>
         <p>“Come over here. I want you closer.”</p>
         <p>Closer wasn’t cool, but she pulled the chair to the bed and sat down. She covered
            herself with the extra blanket, tucking it under her chin. “I hate hospitals.”</p>
         <p>“You’ve been in one?”</p>
         <p>“I have.” He wasn’t the only one that experienced pain. She shifted in the chair. “I had
            this best friend… Paul. We grew up together.”</p>
         <p>“Had.” The muscle in his jaw popped, evidence he guessed the trajectory of her
            story.</p>
         <p>“When I turned sixteen, we decided to date. I’m not sure why. It wasn’t like I liked him
            that way. I think I just didn’t want to see him with somebody else, because then he’d
            have no time for me.” It sounded lame.</p>
         <p>“You felt like you were losing him.”</p>
         <p>“That is exactly how I felt. How did you know that?”</p>
         <p>He shrugged. “Years of therapy.”</p>
         <p>“Anyway,” she continued, “I knew right away the relationship was a mistake. Making out
            was awkward and embarrassing. Paul wanted more, I didn’t. It sounds dumb, but I kept
            thinking, ‘he’s not the one.’” She cleared her throat. “I wanted to go back to being
            friends, but everyone thought we were this perfect couple, so I let it go on. Longer
            than it should have.”</p>
         <p>James narrowed his eyes. “What happened?”</p>
         <p>There was a change in his tone. One she wouldn’t have noticed before this weekend, but
            now recognized. He didn’t like what he was hearing.</p>
         <p>“One night, Paul got mad when I refused to do what he wanted. I told him I wanted to
            leave, to break up with him. He ripped my shirt off and I slapped him. He hit me back.
            Hard.”</p>
         <p>“Did he…?” James stalled, his expression blank, one hand tangled in the sheets; her
            tight corner pulled untucked.</p>
         <p>“He didn’t rape me,” she said, “he snapped out of it—realized what he’d done—and begged
            me not to tell anyone. I walked home in shock. I didn't even put my shoes on. It was
            December.”</p>
         <p>“Does Cal know any of this?”</p>
         <p>She shook her head. “I should have slept with Paul. Maybe I would have grown to want him
            like that.”</p>
         <p>James relinquished his hold on the bedding and cracked his knuckles. “It doesn’t work
            that way. You either feel something for someone or you don’t. What happened when you got
            home?”</p>
         <p>“No one was there, so I showered and got dressed. I tried to pretend everything was the
            same, but I couldn’t stop crying. When my mom got home, she took one look at my face and
            freaked out. I ended up in the hospital emergency with a hairline fracture to my orbital
            bone.</p>
         <p>“They wanted to keep me for observation, but I begged to go home. My parents got into
            this huge fight over my dad always giving in to me, and I ended up going home with him.
            My mom disappeared for a week. Her standard M.O. when things don't go her way.”</p>
         <p>“Your mom sounds like a piece of work.” James huffed. “What about the jackass?”</p>
         <p>“My dad knew we broke up, but I lied about what happened. I told him I got hit with a
            ball in gym, but Paul assumed I told everyone what he did.” She blinked. This part hurt
            the most. “By the time I got back to school, he had told everyone I cheated on him, got
            pregnant, and had an abortion. And everyone believed him. I lived in the bible belt.
            Most of my friends were strict Baptists. Nobody had abortions.”</p>
         <p>James rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I bet.”</p>
         <p>“When I went back to school, Paul harassed me—notes on my locker, texts, that type of
            thing. I promised him I didn't tell anyone and begged him to make up, but the more I
            persisted the crueler he became.” She shuddered. “I failed the first semester, then
            dropped out.”</p>
         <p>“Is that why you moved?”</p>
         <p>“Sort of. My dad got this offer and figured it would be good for me. My mom, not so
            much. But my mom was never there for me. She dumped me on a nanny as soon as I was born.
            I’m sure she got pregnant to trap my dad. She never wanted me.”</p>
         <p>Her chest tightened. She never admitted that to anyone. “I don’t know what’s wrong with
            me. Why I even tried to be friends with Paul again.”</p>
         <p>“Maybe you think you deserve the abuse.” He laid his head against the pillow, eyes
            forward. “Why are you telling me this?”</p>
         <p>She took a breath and decided to be truthful. “Because sometimes you seem as alone as I
            feel.”</p>
         <p>“You’re wrong, Cassie.” He reclined his bed, the quiet hum of the motor the only noise.
            “I’m not lonely.”</p>
         <p>She sunk farther into the chair. What had she expected? For him to cry and admit she was
            right?</p>
         <p>“Hey,” he said, his voice softer. He reached for her hand. “You should tell Cal.”</p>
         <p>“Are you going to tell him?”</p>
         <p>“Hell no. That’s your call.” He squeezed her hand, his eyes blank, like he expended the
            last of his energy comforting her. He stared toward the ceiling, lost to her, until his
            eyes closed, and his grip relaxed.</p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 20</h4>
         <p>Sleep was impossible. James mumbled nonstop and thrashed back and forth so violently,
            Cassie extended the bed rails. Minutes slow ticked into hours. At the first sign of pink
            on the horizon, she went in search of his help.</p>
         <p>Still early, the nursing station seemed sleepy. Cassie sized up the lone woman staring
            groggily into the computer monitor. “I think my friend needs pain medication. Room
            601.”</p>
         <p>“You must be Cassie.” The woman examined her from behind the counter. She didn’t smile.
            “We don't want him in pain any more than you do, but if he refuses the prescribed
            medication, there is nothing we can do.”</p>
         <p>“When my grandpa was in the hospital,” Cassie countered, “he had pain relief at the push
            of a button.”</p>
         <p>The nurse lumbered into a standing position. “I'm guessing Grandpa didn't have the
            toxicology report or the history we have on your boyfriend.”</p>
         <p>“James may have had drugs in his system, but he’s not some homeless addict.” Why did
            everyone expect the worst from him?</p>
         <p>“Maybe not.” The nurse removed her glasses and met Cassie’s gaze. “But he is on an
            individual pain management program. One that does not involve being able to
            self-medicate. If he wants to feel better, you need to get him to swallow the pills we
            are giving him. And, while you are at it, get him to stop swearing at hospital
            personnel.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The sound of running water greeted Cassie when she returned to James’ room. Groaning,
            she approached the half-open bathroom door. “James, what are you doing in there?”</p>
         <p>“Taking a shower. Feel free to join me.”</p>
         <p>She peeked through the doorway. Sure enough, steam billowed over the top of the shower
            curtain.</p>
         <p>“Are you supposed to get those stitches wet?” Damn, didn't he think? Ever?</p>
         <p>“Don't care. I was manky.”</p>
         <p>Sighing, she headed back to the nursing station and approached the same woman. “Can he
            shower?”</p>
         <p>The nurse typed something into the computer. “It’s been over thirty hours. A gentle
            shower won’t hurt. Did someone go over proper wound care with him?”</p>
         <p>“I’m not sure.” It wasn’t like he would listen.</p>
         <p>The nurse grunted. “Tell Mr. Fitzpatrick I’m coming to see him and to leave the area
            uncovered.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The water was off when Cassie returned. James emerged a few seconds later. The tip of
            his unbandaged stitches, angry against his skin, peaked out above a low wrapped
            towel.</p>
         <p>“Where’s that bag of clothes?” he asked, “The clown pants were a blast, but it’s time
            for something a little more enticing.”</p>
         <p>“Enticing?” The titter in her voice infuriated her. She grabbed the bag off the table
            and tossed it at him.</p>
         <p>James flinched as the bag hit his shoulder. It landed at his feet. With a grimace, he
            carefully stooped to retrieve it. After digging out his underwear retreated into the
            bathroom. A minute later, he stood before her, briefs on, the towel around his neck.</p>
         <p>Lounging against the bathroom’s door frame, he resembled an advertisement for male
            undergarments.</p>
         <p>“What?” His smile was coy. “It's not like you haven't seen me in these before. In fact,
            I think I wore these exact ones the night you materialized in the pool house.”</p>
         <p>The smell of antiseptic soap lingered in the stale hospital air as he brushed past. He
            propped himself against the side of the bed and pulled the waistband of his underwear
            away from his stomach. He peered downward. “Jaysus. These stitches are nasty.”</p>
         <p>Her heart fluttered. He was being far too flirty and was way too naked. She helped him
            into the high bed and drew the covers up, minding her eyes, careful not to feed into his
            game.</p>
         <p>“Another nurse is coming to see you.” The words rushed out of her.</p>
         <p>“Is she hot?”</p>
         <p>Cassie shook her head. The nurse looked like she should have retired—twenty years ago.
            She couldn’t wait to see his reaction.</p>
         <p>James groaned. “If I'm going to keep getting molested by hospital staff, they could at
            least be good looking.”</p>
         <p>“Wouldn’t it be easier if they weren’t?”</p>
         <p>He cocked an eyebrow. “And why is that?”</p>
         <p>“You know.” Did she have to spell it out? “The location of your stitches. People
            prodding around—down there.” This whole experience would be so much easier if he got
            stabbed in the shoulder.</p>
         <p>James laughed. His real laugh. “I'm a big boy. I have everything under control.” He
            batted his lashes. “How ‘bout you? Want to check out my injury? See what my response is?
            Test my control?”</p>
         <p>Everything was a joke to him. Refusing to be his punch line, she crossed her arms. “I’ve
            seen enough.”</p>
         <p>Both his eyebrows shot up. “Saw enough? How much was that?”</p>
         <p>Between bandages and common courtesy, she hadn't seen much, but her skin flushed just
            the same. “There’s no point in embarrassing you.”</p>
         <p>“I'm not embarrassed,” he said, although his pink cheeks suggested otherwise.</p>
         <p>A girl not much older than them pushed a cart into the room. Her tight, hot pink scrubs
            suggested they were altered. James flipped Cassie a surprised look, then smiled his
            approval. “Dia duit álainn.”</p>
         <p>The girl parked her cart alongside James’ bed, then tucked a strand of long blonde hair
            behind her ear. “I’m not sure what that means but I’m Linda. And you are Mr.
            Fitzpatrick, correct?”</p>
         <p>Nodding, he lifted his arm so she could check his hospital bracelet. “I said, hello,
            beautiful.”</p>
         <p>Cassie stared at the girl. Linda was a huge improvement over the much older, and way
            heavier nurse, but beautiful? Her name tag dangled off a lanyard, the letters CNA in
            full view. Cassie braced for James’ flip out, but he allowed Linda to check his
            bracelet.</p>
         <p>“Let’s take your blood pressure.” Linda picked up a cuff from the cart. “Hold out your
            arm for me. I love your ink, by the way.”</p>
         <p>“Where is the nurse on duty?” Cassie interrupted.</p>
         <p>Linda remained quiet until she removed the cuff. “Nurse Toleman was busy. I volunteered
            to help.”</p>
         <p>“Lucky me,” James said, hands laced behind his head.</p>
         <p>“Aww. You’re too cute.” Linda shooed Cassie away from the bed. “Do you mind giving us
            some privacy?” She drew the curtain without waiting for a reply.</p>
         <p>Cassie stomped to the window and pressed her forehead against the cool glass. Leave it
            to James to find someone to flirt with in a hospital.</p>
         <p>“What happened to your gown?” Linda’s voice floated from behind the curtain. “Let's move
            these down a bit so I can get a look at those stitches.”</p>
         <p>“You're really great at this, Linda,” James said, his voice smooth. “I bet you’re good
            at a lot of things.”</p>
         <p>Something twisted in Cassie’s stomach. She inched toward the curtain.</p>
         <p>“Shh.” Linda chuckled. “Tell me if this hurts?”</p>
         <p>“Not much,” James said, “do you like what you see?”</p>
         <p>Cassie swung the curtain open. “Are you done yet?” Linda’s hand rested on James’
            stomach. They both turned to stare at her. Cassie jerked the curtain shut, then rushed
            out the door.</p>
         <p>In the cafeteria, she called Caleb again, craving the security he gave her. Still no
            answer. Come on. It was Sunday, his parents must be home by now. Armed with a machine
            latte, she laid her cheek on the cool table and studied the side of her cup. What was
            her problem? James was not her boyfriend and she made a complete fool of herself. If she
            planned to go back to the room, she would need to be more composed—and less insane.</p>
         <p>An hour later, Cassie eased open the door to James’ room. He glanced up, then went back
            his magazine. “Linda brought me something to read,” he said. “Isn't she super?”</p>
         <p>A selection of books lay beside the tray of his half-eaten breakfast. “I’m glad she took
            care of you,” Cassie said.</p>
         <p>He inspected her with wide eyes, his brow wrinkled. Not that she could blame his baffled
            expression. She considered apologizing for her outburst, but could only mumble, “I
            should go home.” With a bowed head, she turned to open the door.</p>
         <p>“Wait.” Surprising her with how quickly he moved, he pulled up behind her. “You’re
            always running from me.”</p>
         <p>“I am not.”</p>
         <p>James stretched his arm over her shoulder and pressed his palm against the closed door.
            “What is going on with you?”</p>
         <p>“Nothing,” she said, “nothings going on with me.”</p>
         <p>“Seriously, Cassie. Turn around. I want you to look at me.”</p>
         <p>Sighing, she faced him. A tiny bit of roughness decorated his chin. His hip bones grazed
            hers.</p>
         <p>“You seemed almost jealous of that nurse.”</p>
         <p>“That’s ludicrous.” There wasn’t enough space between them, but there was too much
            space. “I just think CNA's should do other, less important things,” she said with closed
            eyes, “like cleaning bedpans or mopping up puke.”</p>
         <p>“If you ask me, she should have been the one to remove my catheter.”</p>
         <p>Cassie opened her eyes and glared at him. Little flecks of hazel twinkled in the green
            of his irises.</p>
         <p>“I'm joking. It's just…” He adjusted his feet, his leg between hers. “I got the
            impression you didn't like her hands on me.” He lowered his head.</p>
         <p>She needed to shove him, slap him, call his bluff. She held her breath.</p>
         <p>Wincing, he withdrew his arm and stepped back, unsteady. “Damnit.” He pressed his hand
            against his wound.</p>
         <p>For once fate sided with her. She unglued herself from the door and took hold of James’
            elbow. “Let's get you back to bed,” she said in Linda's sing-song voice.</p>
         <p>James chuckled. “Linda was pretty.” He searched her face. “Her hands were warm.”</p>
         <p>Linda’s warm hands were none of her business. Keeping her expression neutral, Cassie
            spread the blanket over him.</p>
         <p>James retrieved a piece of paper from the side table. “She gave me her number.”</p>
         <p>“Doesn’t that break some sort of nursing code?”</p>
         <p>“I think it’s cool.” Blinking innocently, he shoved the paper at her. “It's not like I
            have a girlfriend, and I have a thing for blondes.”</p>
         <p>Cassie unfolded the paper. Linda penned her digits in red, complete with a heart over
            the i.</p>
         <p>“Have you slept with Cal yet?”</p>
         <p>“Huh?” James’ question came from nowhere. She tossed the number onto the bed. “You
            didn't just ask me that.”</p>
         <p>He grinned. “You’ll have to put out eventually.”</p>
         <p>“Really.” She hated that he knew she was a virgin. “What else does Caleb say about
            me?”</p>
         <p>James crinkled the paper and tossed it onto the table. “Cal refuses to talk about
            you.”</p>
         <p>“You’ve questioned him?”</p>
         <p>He grinned wider. “I'm feeling better. Watch this.” He held his hand out. It didn’t
            shake as much. “You'll be pleased to know I took your advice.”</p>
         <p>“How so?” She set the crib board up for another game.</p>
         <p>“I was polite and took my medication. You’d have been proud, but you were off skulking
            and missed it.”</p>
         <p>“I wasn't skulking. I wanted to give you and Linda some alone time.”</p>
         <p>Taking her place in her chair, she counted six cards apiece. “Are you ever going to tell
            me what you took on Friday?”</p>
         <p>“Probably not. But it’s not as bad as everyone assumes.”</p>
         <p>Cassie looked up from her cards.</p>
         <p>“Come on, Cassie. I realize what everyone thinks. That I'm some crazy needle user.”</p>
         <p>Without meaning to, she flicked her gaze to his arms.</p>
         <p>“Don't search too hard,” he said. “Cal’s always checking for needle marks, but I
            wouldn't take a hit in my arm. Think about it. You can push a needle in anywhere.”</p>
         <p>The thought of James sticking needles into his body nauseated her.</p>
         <p>“Relax. I won’t be doing anything for a bit.” He ran his fingers through his hair. “All
            this bullshit bought me time in rehab.”</p>
         <p>“When did you find this out?” She barely left his side.</p>
         <p>“Dr. Madison told me yesterday.” He touched her cheek. You didn’t think I was this
            fecked up, did you? You should run.”</p>
         <p>“W-When?” she stammered, lost in the tractor beam of his gaze and the warmth of his
            gesture.</p>
         <p>“I would run now.”</p>
         <p>“No. When do you go?”</p>
         <p>“When I get out of here. Tomorrow.”</p>
         <p>The door opened. James’ hand dropped from her face. Cassie turned, expecting to see CNA
            Linda, but Caleb stood in the doorway. A purple bruise on his cheek blended into the
            dark circles under his eyes.</p>
         <p>She wanted Caleb this entire weekend, but now that he was here, the timing seemed wrong.
            She backed away from the bed, putting as much space between her and James as the room
            allowed.</p>
         <p>“Holy fuck.” Caleb crossed the floor in a few determined strides. He hadn’t noticed
            James’ hand on her cheek. It was like he didn’t notice her at all.</p>
         <p>He slumped forward, palms on the mattress. “No one would tell me how you were all
            weekend.”</p>
         <p>“You look worse than me.” James stated the obvious, knots forming in his forehead. “How
            was Juvie?”</p>
         <p>“Here.” Caleb pulled a ring from his pocket. “This was the only thing the front desk had
            of yours.” He waited until James slid it on, before continuing. “My weekend sucked. But
            you hear a lot in there. Like the dude that stabbed you sold Percocet.”</p>
         <p>The creases in James’ brow deepened. He nodded to where she stood against the
            windows.</p>
         <p>“Cassie.” Caleb spread his arms wide, his knuckles red scabby. “Get over here.”</p>
         <p>She snuggled against him, enjoying the solid shape of his body and the safety of his
            arms.</p>
         <p>“Thanks for babysitting,” he whispered, before issuing a soft kiss on her lips.</p>
         <p>“Where’s Mom?” James said, loudly. “You can’t be here by yourself. Getting stabbed must
            merit the attention of at least one parent.”</p>
         <p>“She stopped by the bathroom.” Caleb draped his arm over Cassie’s shoulder. “Why don’t
            you go home and get some rest? We can take it from here.”</p>
         <p>James turned his icy glare to her. “Yeah, Cassie. Thanks for babysitting.”</p>
         <p>“Don’t be a jerk.” Caleb squeezed her shoulders. “I’m sure she had better things to do
            than hang here, letting you snarl at her.” He pulled two twenties from his wallet. “Can
            you grab a taxi?”</p>
         <p>“Go on.” James waved. “Bugger off.”</p>
         <p>What an ass. She thought something magical happened between them, that they at least
            became friends. But he used her because she was all he had at the time. She gave Caleb a
            passionate kiss. “I’ll come by the pool house tonight,” she said, as she withdrew from
            his embrace. “I’ll make you feel better.”</p>
         <p>The words tumbled out. She didn’t want to see Caleb. She wanted space, time to process
            the weekend. But it was too late. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 21</h4>
         <p>“Good feckin riddance,” James said as soon as he collected himself enough to talk. “Glad
            she’s not my bitc—”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth appeared in the doorway, the horror on her face an unwelcome reminder of how
            much he’d fucked up.</p>
         <p>“James.” She rushed to the bed. “You scared us to death.”</p>
         <p>No longer in a congenial mood, he struggled to remain still while she fussed over him.
            When she broke into tears, he sent Caleb a withered look.</p>
         <p>“Mom.” Caleb placed his arm around her. “You’re smothering him.”</p>
         <p>“Sorry.” She pulled a tissue from her purse and dabbed the dark crescents under her
            eyes. Shadows he’d put there. “Dr. Madison filled me in. Are you okay with what he
            suggests?</p>
         <p>Relief evaporated from Caleb’s face. He glanced between them.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth dropped into Cassie’s chair. She folded the tissue into a square and smoothed
            it. “You can’t keep going down this path, James.”</p>
         <p>The only path he wanted to go down was the one leading to his bed. Watching Cassie kiss
            Cal sucked all the air from his lungs. He was exhausted, and this conversation wasn’t
            helping. Rehab was beginning to sound like a vacation.</p>
         <p>Caleb braced his hands behind his head. “Why wasn’t I informed of anything?”</p>
         <p>“Because,” Elizabeth started slowly, “James’ treatment is between his doctor and
            him.”</p>
         <p>“And apparently you,” James pointed out. His stomach churned. “What’s the fucking point
            of being emancipated if everybody’s in your bloody business.”</p>
         <p>Caleb put his hand on James’ shoulder. “Take it easy on Mom. She was so upset, I had to
            drive here.”</p>
         <p>He shrugged off Caleb’s arm, bitter he'd given Cassie those pills. Then tonight, he
            would be blissfully out of it, rather than lying in a hospital bed awake, alone and
            thinking.</p>
         <p>“It’s okay, Cal.” Elizabeth sniffled. “He feels abandoned. I shouldn’t have gone on that
            trip with David.”</p>
         <p>Caleb paced away from the bed. “Let’s just get him home. Not the pool house. Home so I
            can keep an eye on him.”</p>
         <p>“Jaysus. I'm right here,” James said, “I can hear you.”</p>
         <p>“I just want to get out of here and forget this whole weekend.” Cal leaned against the
            windows.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth squared her shoulders. “Caleb, you're not going to like what I'm about to say,
            but it’s going to happen. We can’t take James home.”</p>
         <p>“Why not?” Caleb returned to the bed. “Would somebody tell me what the hell is going
            on?”</p>
         <p>“My doctor wants some quality time with me,” James said, since Elizabeth couldn’t get
            her act together and he wanted everyone to leave. “He's requesting I attend a week of
            sessions at Rosecrance Treatment Center in Rockford—as an inpatient.”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth released a sigh. Relieved she didn’t have to say it—or relieved he was
            leaving, he couldn’t tell.</p>
         <p>“Bullshit.” Caleb gripped James' arm. “Mom. Call Dr. Madison. Do something.”</p>
         <p>“There's nothing I can do. James agreed to go.” She dabbed her eyes again, with what was
            left of the tissue.</p>
         <p>Caleb stared at him open-mouthed. “What the hell, dude?”</p>
         <p>Tired of the conversation, James shrugged.</p>
         <p>“I cleared your schedule.” Elizabeth smiled, but her eyes were flat, empty of the
            forgiveness she usually showered on him. “David will pick you up in the morning.”</p>
         <p>“Dad’s picking him up?” Caleb spun to face her, his fingers sliding through his hair</p>
         <p>“Caleb.” Elizabeth’s tone carried a warning James hadn’t heard since they were in middle
            school. “You're in no position to comment. What were you thinking, drinking and
            fighting?”</p>
         <p>“I was thinking some asshole stuck a knife in my brother.” Caleb kicked the leg of the
            bed. “You're treating us like little kids.”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth rose. “Maybe your dad and I need to remember, legally you still are children.
            This is a wake-up call for all of us.” She snapped her fingers in front of James’ face.
            “Are you getting any of this?”</p>
         <p>“Got it.” He focused on the blue of Elizabeth’s eyes, the same shade as Caleb’s.
            “Getting chauffeured to rehab by David. My life’s a feckin storybook.”</p>
         <p>“Good, because this,” she motioned to the hospital bed, “isn't acceptable. I think it’s
            time we try a more serious form of intervention—and I don’t want any problems.”</p>
         <p>“Problems?” James held his breath.</p>
         <p>“I’m aware of the damage you did when you arrived here.”</p>
         <p>He choked out a laugh. “Please don’t tell me you think I could hit you?”</p>
         <p>“I don't know what to think.” She looked away. “About any of this.”</p>
         <p>The accusation was sobering. Elizabeth couldn’t be scared of him. She was the only
            mother he had. Next to Cal, she’d been his most staunch defender—and he’d exhausted
            her.</p>
         <p>“What’d you do?” Caleb asked. “You were unconscious last time I saw you.”</p>
         <p>The weekend’s events pressed down on James like a wet blanket, suffocating him. He
            reached for Caleb. “Help me up. I need to piss.”</p>
         <p>Caleb helped him out of bed and followed close behind as he shuffled to the bathroom.
            Once they were inside, James straightened. His sudden recovery registered as surprise on
            Caleb’s face. “You didn’t need my help? What’s up?”</p>
         <p>“Mom’s scared of me now?”</p>
         <p>“She's scared for you. Not of you.” Caleb leaned against the door. “And truthfully, I am
            too. I don’t want anything bad to happen.”</p>
         <p>James washed his hands and tore open a package of gauze with his teeth. Edging his
            underwear down, he exposed the good size rectangle bandage which he peeled back. The
            area itched like mad.</p>
         <p>Caleb looked away, his exhale whistling. “Shit, James. You could have died.”</p>
         <p>“I screwed up.” He wasn’t too proud to admit it. He cleaned the area the way Linda
            showed him. “I’ll swallow the consequences, but it hurts to think your mom is done with
            me.”</p>
         <p>Caleb groaned. “I knew you were reading her that way. She won’t change her mind about
            wanting you. Shit, she worries more about you than me.”</p>
         <p>When he didn’t reply, Caleb touched his arm. “You're freaking me out, man. Promise me,
            no more, pills. Everything will be alright.”</p>
         <p>James took his time washing his hands. Nothing was alright. He’d always suffered
            nightmares but the last two nights, splices of his past floated behind his eyes. He’d
            woken haunted by visions—and worse—knew them to be true. Seeing Cassie curled up in the
            chair across from him was the only thing that kept him in his head all weekend.</p>
         <p>He dried his hands. “I dreamt about my mom.”</p>
         <p>“No way,” Caleb said, his voice light. “What about?”</p>
         <p>In his dream, his mother cradled him as his blood spilled to the floor. It was an
            accident she said, I didn’t mean it.</p>
         <p>“I don’t want to talk about it,” he said.</p>
         <p>Caleb frowned. “What about Cassie? Did her being here help at all?”</p>
         <p>He pushed any and all thoughts of Cassie away. “I had a hot nurse. She gave me her
            number.”</p>
         <p>“Is that all she gave you?” Caleb lifted an eyebrow.</p>
         <p>James chuckled, though it wasn’t funny. “Too sore for anything else.” </p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 22</h4>
         <p>Caleb held the Charger’s door open for his mom. She climbed into the passenger seat and
            released a broken sob. The fifth one since they’d left James. Not that he counted.</p>
         <p>He slumped in his seat and rested his forehead against the leather steering wheel cover,
            warm from the afternoon sun. “Can’t we just tell Dr. Madison James changed his mind? He
            needs family, not strangers.”</p>
         <p>“He made the right decision, Cal.” Elizabeth fastened her seatbelt, a cue to start the
            engine.</p>
         <p>Leaving James in the hospital when they were ten, sucked. Leaving him now wasn’t any
            easier. It wasn’t fair. James never drove away from him; or had to face the truth—your
            best efforts to save someone—weren’t good enough.</p>
         <p>“I know this isn’t easy,” Elizabeth said, “but for the first time in years, I can relax.
            I don’t have to worry about getting a call like this—or worse. They’ll watch him
            there.”</p>
         <p>“I watch him,” Caleb muttered, only he hadn’t been. Not since Cassie came into the
            picture. He swiped the back of his hand over his eyes then shoved the key into the
            ignition. He was in no condition to drive, but one glance at his mom told him neither
            was she. Her eyes were shut, two fingers pressed between her brows. A sure sign one of
            her headaches loomed on the horizon.</p>
         <p>“James needs more than you watching him. I’m worried he’s getting worse instead of
            better.” She faced him. “What was he doing in that alley?”</p>
         <p>They had this conversation when she picked him up from the police station, at a much
            higher volume. When he pleaded the fifth, she’d asked outright, ‘Is your brother dealing
            drugs? Taking drugs? Are you?’ He was pretty sure his mom knew more than he did at this
            point, and hoped-for disclaimers. He couldn’t provide those, either.</p>
         <p>He shook his head. “James isn’t telling me anything.”</p>
         <p>“Dr. Madison mentioned Cassie spent the weekend at the hospital.”</p>
         <p>“James doesn’t like her much, but…” Having Cassie stay with James may not have been
            ideal. They bickered constantly— fighting over him. But at the time, handcuffed in the
            alley, he was out of options. He gave the Charger a jolt of gas. “I’m not sure where
            you’re going with this, Mom.”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth massaged her temples. “Does she know anything about his past?”</p>
         <p>“Not unless he told her.” Highly unlikely. Caleb honked at the car in front of him.
            Talking about Cassie was off-limits. She was all his. Her attention wasn’t divided. He
            didn’t need to be the perfect one, the one that never got into trouble, because he was
            the only one.</p>
         <p>“Why are you asking about Cassie?”</p>
         <p>“You seem serious about her,” his mother said, “I’m just checking in on how you’re
            doing.”</p>
         <p>That didn’t happen very often. His eyes skated over her, a brief assessment before
            focusing back on traffic. “Relax, Mom. I’m fine.”</p>
         <p>No matter how hard he tried, he failed at giving James, or his mother, what they needed.
            But tonight, when Cassie stopped by, he could give her what she wanted.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie showed up twenty minutes late, in track pants and an oversized tee. It wasn’t the
            attire he expected from someone who’d made her evening’s itinerary clear.</p>
         <p>She stood by the end of the sofa and sniffed the air. “Did you clean?”</p>
         <p>“I did,” Caleb admitted, “and I picked you flowers.” He pointed to the bistro table
            where he vased a small bouquet of his mother’s lilies.</p>
         <p>She frowned at the flowers, then, with a weak smile, plunked onto the cushion. “How’s
            James?”</p>
         <p>“He’s James. We left the hospital early. I think he wanted to be left alone.”</p>
         <p>“Did he seem okay to you?”</p>
         <p>“He looks like shit, and he’s going to rehab. I think he expected our mom to try to talk
            him out of it—but she didn’t.” He sat beside her. “Let’s talk about you and me.”</p>
         <p>“What about us?”</p>
         <p>“About what you said at the hospital. You said you’d make me feel better.” He picked up
            her hand. “I’ve decided to let you.”</p>
         <p>“Let me?” She yanked her hand free and clambered to her feet. “I remember what I said. I
            didn’t realize how exhausted I’d be.”</p>
         <p>He’d worded that wrong, but the expression on her face made him feel like she wasn’t
            interested in him at all. He jumped to his feet. “What the hell, Cassie? You’ve wanted
            sex since I met you. What’s your problem?”</p>
         <p>“Maybe I’m tired.” Her eyes widened. “From dealing with your asshole friend. This would
            never have happened if you hadn’t gotten so drunk.”</p>
         <p>The accusation stung because she was right. He slumped against the cushions. “What do
            you want to do, because I’m sure as hell not begging you for sex.”</p>
         <p>“Good, because you’re not getting any.” She inched toward the door then paused. “I
            shouldn’t have implied you are to blame. It’s not your fault James is where he is.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever.” He couldn’t look at her.</p>
         <p>“I’ll call you after class tomorrow,” she said.</p>
         <p>“Yeah, sure.” He rested his head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 23</h4>
         <p>Caleb turned into the parking lot of the Griffin Williamson campus and shifted into
            park. Not being able to check on James all week was almost as excruciating as seeing the
            knife sticking out of his body, and guilt had settled in. He should have stayed sober
            and followed his friend outside. The mistake could have been fatal.</p>
         <p>He swallowed the bad taste in his mouth and picked up his phone. Taking a few minutes to
            get his emotions under control couldn’t hurt. It wouldn’t do any good to get James in
            the car, then strangle him.</p>
         <p>Locating his mother's number, he typed, Hey, Mom. Arrived safely.</p>
         <p>His mom had been in bed when he left. Her headache eased mid-week but returned last
            night with a vengeance.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>With its huge stone pillars, the campus looked more like a hunting lodge than a
            treatment facility. He pressed the intercom button. After stating his business, the door
            clicked open like a jail cell, banishing all thoughts of vacation.</p>
         <p>“Dr. Madison is ready for you,” the receptionist said, handing him a sign-in sheet and
            name tag. She crossed the carpeted waiting room and motioned for him to follow.</p>
         <p>The faint smell of vanilla tamed the chill of the sparsely decorated hallways. They
            passed a lunchroom filled with residents before stopping at a dark wooden door, bearing
            the nameplate, Dr. R. Madison. M.D., LCP. The receptionist turned the brass handle, and
            despite its impenetrable appearance the door opened, devoid of noise. She gestured for
            him to go into the room.</p>
         <p>Large, leather furniture dominated the generous space. Dr. Madison looked up from where
            he sat, legs stretched across an ottoman, shoes beside his chair. Sunlight from a
            translucent wall of glass blocks splashed across an unfinished chess game.</p>
         <p>James stood at the glass; forehead pressed against the frosted squares.</p>
         <p>“Hello, Dr. Madison. I’m here to pick up James.” Caleb wiped his hand on his shorts
            before he offered it.</p>
         <p>James turned around. A small grin played on his lips, but his clenched fists and wide
            eyes made it clear he wanted to be free of that room.</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison cleared his throat. “Young Mister Patterson. Nice to see you again.”</p>
         <p>“Thank you for letting me come.” Caleb nodded coolly, but Dr. Madison made him nervous
            as hell. James’ psychiatrist was a constant reminder something was wrong with his
            friend. Something he couldn’t fix.</p>
         <p>James moved away from the window. He ambled down the long wall of books, head tipped as
            if searching for something and didn’t care what went on around him, though Caleb
            suspected he listened to every word.</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison waited until James was across the room to speak. “I understand David got
            called out on a flight and Elizabeth is indisposed.”</p>
         <p>James rested his hand on the leather binding of a large book.</p>
         <p>“Plus,” The doctor said, “I consider you more than capable of getting your friend home
            in one piece.”</p>
         <p>“Thank you, sir.” Caleb smiled at the doctor who should have known better than to assume
            James was not paying attention.</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison retrieved a manila envelope from his desk drawer. “Please make sure your
            mother gets this.”</p>
         <p>“Sweet,” James said from the far corner, “I require an instruction manual.”</p>
         <p>Dr. Madison stroked his beard. “I hope these last five days have been insightful, James.
            If there is a repeat occurrence, I'll recommend the full thirty-day stay.”</p>
         <p>Caleb nodded. “I'll do better, sir—” The pinched features on the doctor’s face stopped
            him short.</p>
         <p>“Caleb, James and I discussed this at length. It is not up to you to keep him safe. Who
            is it up to, James?”</p>
         <p>“Me. Yes, I get it.” James turned from the books but failed to meet Dr. Madison’s firm
            expression.</p>
         <p>“That's an important lesson—for both of you.” Dr. Madison shook Caleb’s hand again.
            “Remember. PEI, Monday morning in Naperville.” His gaze followed James as he crossed the
            room. “I'll be upset if you fail to-show.”</p>
         <p>“I’ll be there.” James made it to the door. “Am I free to go?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“I can't believe they let you get me.” Rockford disappeared in the rearview mirror
            before James spoke. He rolled the window down and inhaled. “All the way across the
            state. Freedom at last.”</p>
         <p>Wind whipped through the car, making it hard to hear, but Caleb didn’t have the heart to
            ask him to shut the window.</p>
         <p>“On a Friday, even.” James grinned. “Who gets released from rehab on Friday? That's just
            asking for trouble. What’s that crazy old man thinking?”</p>
         <p>“I think you’re his favorite case. Maybe he's gay.”</p>
         <p>“He's married with children.”</p>
         <p>Caleb shot him a look. “I was joking, asshole. But now I'm wondering how many old guys
            have come on to you.”</p>
         <p>“None,” James rummaged through the glove box and pulled out their emergency pack of
            smokes. He lit a cigarette. “How's Mom? Doctor M insinuated she was ill.”</p>
         <p>“Just one of her migraines.”</p>
         <p>“Courtesy of me.”</p>
         <p>“No, it’s not.” Caleb entered the right lane; they blew past a semi. “You know she gets
            headaches.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah. They started when I was ten.” James took another drag. “Go ahead. Deny it.”</p>
         <p>Caleb couldn’t. His mother’s migraines started when James was ten, the month he came to
            live with them. “What did you do in there, anyway?”</p>
         <p>“What do you think? Got my brain picked apart by my shrink, ate crappy meals, and cried
            myself to sleep every night.”</p>
         <p>“I noticed girls,” Caleb said, “did you at least get laid?”</p>
         <p>“One girl made it clear she would suck dick for smokes. I kept my feckin distance. They
            did have a wicked workout room. Despite having to take it easy, I am in better shape now
            than I was. At least fighting isn’t on my taboo list.”</p>
         <p>The desire to strangle James returned. Caleb tightened his grip on the wheel. “Blow off
            steam another way. There’s no way I’m allowing you to fight.”</p>
         <p>“Allowing me?” James huffed. “You need to lighten up. You heard my doctor. Only I am
            responsible for my actions. Which I believe translates into, you not being
            responsible.”</p>
         <p>“I’ll lighten up when you start caring about living. And I don't give a shit what your
            doctor says. I know you better than he does.”</p>
         <p>James coughed out smoke. “You realize you're talking about my shrink. I'm supposed to
            tell him everything.”</p>
         <p>“Do you?”</p>
         <p>“Yes. No. Maybe. Who cares?”</p>
         <p>Caleb exhaled. “I understand you better than your doctor.”</p>
         <p>“Really?” James took one last drag then flicked his butt out the window. He rolled the
            glass up and silence settled in the car. “Do you think I’m out of control?”</p>
         <p>“Sometimes, yeah.” The reply may cause an angry rebuttal, but he wouldn’t be doing his
            friend any favors if he didn’t give him an honest answer.</p>
         <p>James stared up at the Charger’s white headliner, giving no clues as to how the comment
            sat. A minute later, he grabbed the sunglasses off the dash and reclined the seat.</p>
         <p>Caleb passed another car. He had a vacation day planned. Cassie screwed him around all
            week. Between her and his mother, he needed a break.</p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 24</h4>
         <p>James was awake for a while, trying to figure out his location from reflections in the
            tinted glass. Giving up, he popped the seat and checked out the window. “Where are you
            taking me?”</p>
         <p>Caleb jumped. “When did you wake up?”</p>
         <p>“Just now. Where are we going?” They were north of the city, following the contour of
            the lake southward. An unusual way to get home from Rockford, and through his childhood
            neighborhood.</p>
         <p>“To the beach,” Caleb admitted.</p>
         <p>He sounded hesitant, like he realized he would get flack, rightfully so. The closer
            James got to the southside, the more he wanted to crawl into bed and sleep. Forever.</p>
         <p>James groaned. “Seriously, Cal? I’m wearing jeans.”</p>
         <p>“I brought you shorts and a shirt… flip-flops… beach chairs… and towels.”</p>
         <p>“Does this outing include alcohol?” He could hope.</p>
         <p>“Nope. I just scoped out a party for tomorrow night, up here in Edgewater, and I won't
            say a word if you cut loose. But can we stay sober today? Just us, the sun, and the
            water, checking out the talent. Five days of abstinence must have you wound pretty
            tight.”</p>
         <p>James turned back to the window. One girl haunted him all week, and mercifully, it
            didn’t sound like she was on the beach.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>*</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Should I buy a boat?” The sound of the surf, and the sun hot on James’ back, made
            drifting away feel like an actual possibility.</p>
         <p>“That would be cool.” Caleb’s voice came from behind, where he’d set his chair on higher
            ground. “Girls love to party on boats.”</p>
         <p>“Girls?” Waves splashed James’ calves and soaked the ass of his shorts. He moved his
            chair and settled down beside Caleb. “Did you and Cassie get into a fight?”</p>
         <p>“I hardly saw her.” Caleb’s face remained blank. “She spent most of the week studying
            for her session one final. But since you brought her up, I wanted to talk to you about
            the hospital.”</p>
         <p>“I wasn't rude to her, I swear it.”</p>
         <p>“She hasn't complained. In fact, she hasn't said much about anything.”</p>
         <p>“What's your issue then?” James ran his fingers through his hair. Everything about
            Cassie had become a problem.</p>
         <p>“I didn't say there was something wrong. Damn.” Caleb pulled two bottles of water from
            the small cooler and tossed him one. “I want to apologize for siccing her on you.”</p>
         <p>The hospital weekend remained fresh in James’ memory. He’d almost kissed Cassie. He
            should be the one apologizing. “She rode in the back of the ambulance,” he said, “I
            think they stripped me naked.”</p>
         <p>“Naked? As in completely?”</p>
         <p>“There’s no such thing as privacy when you’re bleeding to death. I woke up in a backless
            gown with tubes sticking out of me. Everywhere.”</p>
         <p>“Shit. “Caleb shook his head. “It’s just… I saw them secure you to that board thing, and
            I knew. I knew you would be terrified when you woke up if you couldn’t move. I didn't
            want you to be alone. I’m not sure what Cassie saw. I can ask her if you want?”</p>
         <p>“Hell no! Leave it alone. I want her to forget the whole experience.”</p>
         <p>He’d love to forget also—but one question festered in his gut all week. It wouldn’t go
            away, no matter how much iron he pumped or how much pain he was in. He kept his gaze on
            the far horizon, where Indiana’s, Mount Baldy was visible across the state line. “So,
            did you hit that ride on Sunday?”</p>
         <p>“I told you. I hardly saw her.”</p>
         <p>“Did she find out you model?” Something was different.</p>
         <p>Caleb turned toward him. “She’ll find out soon enough when school starts. Might as well
            wait.”</p>
         <p>“She'll be pissed if she hears it elsewhere. Girls hate being lied to.”</p>
         <p>“I'm not lying to her.” Caleb crinkled his bottle and threw it into the cooler. “She
            doesn’t need to know everything about me.”</p>
         <p>Cassie did not deserve to be lied to, but him and Caleb could not get on the same page
            when it came to her. James stood. He needed something to keep his brain engaged and his
            mouth shut. Caleb was right about one thing. Half-naked girls were all over the
            place.</p>
         <p>“See those girls playing volleyball?” He chinned to the small group about sixty feet
            away. “They’ve been giving us the glad eye since we sat down.”</p>
         <p>Caleb twisted to look over his shoulder. A red-haired girl waved at them.</p>
         <p>James waved back. “If we don't go over there, they'll come here. I’d rather go there so
            we can ditch them when we want.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>*</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Five volleyball games later, James laid his towel on the warm sand and stretched out on
            his belly. He turned away from where Cal sat, snuggled with the redhead, riotously named
            Amber. He didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to recognize Cal was looking to get
            laid—and he wanted no part of it.</p>
         <p>A shadow cast over him, and a foot prodded his ribs. “Wake up.”</p>
         <p>He ignored Caleb’s foot the same as he ignored the blonde girl that crept onto the edge
            of his towel.</p>
         <p>“I know you’re not sleeping,” Caleb said, his voice next to James’ ear.</p>
         <p>James rolled over and sat up. He pressed his forehead against his knees. What part of
            tired did Caleb fail to understand? Probably the same part that forgot what taken
            meant.</p>
         <p>The blonde claimed more real estate on his towel. What the hell was her name? Not that
            he gave a shit. Standing, he brushed sand from his body. “This is great, but I’m gonna
            head out.”</p>
         <p>The blonde sighed in protest as he strode to fold up his chair. Caleb came up behind
            him. “In case you failed to notice, these girls are hot, into us, and getting
            shitfaced.”</p>
         <p>“I noticed the shitfaced part. Thanks for policing me tonight so I couldn't join
            them.”</p>
         <p>Caleb groaned. “Great, now you're pissed at me.”</p>
         <p>“I’m not mad.” James yawned. “Get Ronnie to be your winger, he won’t blab. But I’m
            tired, and one of us should check on Mom. Maybe I’ll watch a movie with her.”</p>
         <p>“I’m not calling Ron.” Caleb glanced toward the girls. “The redhead’s hot, and Mary’s
            into you. What if we go someplace relaxing? Party of four. Red’s hungry and I promised
            I'd take her to eat.”</p>
         <p>“I’m not going anywhere.” And neither should you, not that he’d ever say that.</p>
         <p>“Stop looking at me like that,” Caleb said, “it’s been a weird week. I thought Cassie
            wanted to screw around, then she did this complete about-face. Jesus. She’s confusing
            the hell out of me.”</p>
         <p>James stifled a small smile, Cassie hadn’t slept with Cal. He raised his eyebrow. “Maybe
            you weren’t persuasive enough.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever.” Caleb stepped toward the girls. “I’d rather get it elsewhere than push her.
            Besides, it’s just dinner. I'll be home right behind you.”</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>James waited until he was in the Uber to turn his phone on. It was against the rules to
            have it the first three days of rehab, and after that, it had to be checked out from the
            desk. He hadn’t cared. The person he wanted to talk to would only make his life more
            difficult.</p>
         <p>Most of his messages were from Alexa. He deleted them, leaving them unread.</p>
         <p>There was a voicemail from Cassie. His finger lingered over the delete button before he
            pressed play.</p>
         <p>“Hope you’re enjoying your day in the sun. Have fun.”</p>
         <p>So, Caleb shared his kidnapping plan with her. The image of them conspiring twisted his
            stomach. He turned his phone off and shoved it into his pocket.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Hey.” The driver nudged his shoulder. “Wake up.”</p>
         <p>They were parked in Caleb’s driveway. He must be completely messed-up to fall asleep in
            the ten minutes since they stopped for snacks.</p>
         <p>“James.” Elizabeth sat up from where she’d stretched across the sofa. “I didn't expect
            to see you till tomorrow. Where's Cal? He's supposed to be with you.”</p>
         <p>“I released him of his duties. Want to watch a movie?” He held up the chips, hopeful.
            “Can I stay in here tonight?” The last thing he needed was a midnight visit from
            Cassie.</p>
         <p>“It's your room. You never need to ask.” She swung her feet to the floor. “I'll get a
            bowl.”</p>
         <p>“I'll get it.” Her headache was his fault. It was the least he could do.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>On autopilot, he scanned for a comedy. Cal’s mom hated horror and enjoyed a better sense
            of humor than her son. Besides, he wanted to fall asleep to laughter.</p>
         <p>“Sorry, for making you sick,” he said and meant it. Elizabeth was nothing but kind to
            him. Back when bouts of anxiety-induced vomiting were a weekly occurrence, she would sit
            outside the locked bathroom door trying to talk him down.</p>
         <p>Back before he learned the placating effects of alcohol.</p>
         <p>Half asleep, he stretched to touch her hand. “I don’t mean to make you suffer. I never
            meant to hurt my real mom either. But no matter what I did, she paid.”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth drew a sharp breath and seemed to hold it.</p>
         <p>The opening credits blurred. He fell asleep before she exhaled. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 25</h4>
         <p>Not wanting to wait inside Alexa's Prius while she fussed with makeup, James leaned
            against the back door and lit a cigarette. Even from half a block away, the faint sound
            of dance music reached him. Pulling the smoke deep into his lungs, he stared down the
            street toward his childhood home, a block away from the party.</p>
         <p>The neighborhood looked the same. The houses on the east side had backyards facing the
            lake, but were worth the same as the houses on the west side, although the taxes were
            higher. A bone of contention with his stepfather.</p>
         <p>Without looking in his direction, Alexa slammed the driver door and headed toward the
            party. Snickering, he enjoyed her rear view as she struggled over the asphalt. She
            picked one hell of a night to wear four-inch heels, but her ass looked hot in her tight,
            red mini skirt.</p>
         <p>She turned to glare at him. “Look at all these cars. This is a huge party.”</p>
         <p>He shrugged but couldn't hide his grin. To discourage her from coming, he insisted the
            party would be a small, high school thing, and now she was pissed. Pity for her. He
            didn’t give a rat’s ass how angry she was. Thanks to her stash of weed, there wasn’t
            much he cared about. Not even his location.</p>
         <p>He jammed his hands into his pockets and found the extra joints he rolled while Alexa
            showered. At some point tonight Cassie would show, and float into Cal’s waiting arms.
            The scene would be easier to tolerate, stoned.</p>
         <p>Alexa waited for him a few cars down. “Don’t give me that stupid smile of yours.”</p>
         <p>“I swear, no one told me it was this big of an event.” Chuckling, he passed her. With
            any luck, he would lose her in the crowd.</p>
         <p>The party was on the east side of the street. A heavy urn filled with umbrellas and a
            couple of lacrosse sticks propped the front door open. Inside, the party was in full
            swing.</p>
         <p>James veered left from the tiled foyer, through open pocket doors. He inched his way
            along the crowded living room; Alexa close behind. Tall, French doors dominated the back
            wall and allowed a hind view of the disc jockey as he waved his hands in the air,
            pumping up the crowd.</p>
         <p>James stopped to watch. For a few seconds Alexa shimmied to the beat, then she tugged
            him under a wide arch where a long, dining room table was pushed against another set of
            doors. Outside, on the deck, the crowd cheered with the D.J.</p>
         <p>A second archway led to the kitchen. Here, the deck was less crowded, and the lake
            loomed, a mammoth black mass in the distance. Its shoreline of lime grass and rushes
            were the perfect place for a child to hide. The thought made him shiver.</p>
         <p>He turned from the doors and scanned the kitchen for alcohol. Sure enough, two kegs were
            set up in the corner. He nudged Alexa. “Beer?”</p>
         <p>The stack of red cups had dwindled down to a single, open package. He filled two of them
            and handed her one. “Need anything else?”</p>
         <p>“Going somewhere?” she asked.</p>
         <p>“I left my phone in your car. If you’re okay, I’ll go get it.”</p>
         <p>With a sigh, she dropped her keys into his outstretched hand. “Don’t take off.”</p>
         <p>She had nothing to worry about. He would rather be flogged than be seen driving a
            Prius.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After burning a joint, he returned to the living room where a group of girls showed off
            their dance moves, none of whom he wanted to converse with. He jerked his hood up as his
            phone vibrated against his spine, where he stashed it under his waistband.</p>
         <p>Hey, bro. Caleb sent. Can’t meet you. Getting lucky with Red.</p>
         <p>Going to this party was Caleb’s idea. Where did that leave Cassie? Where did that leave
            him?</p>
         <p>Isn’t Cassie meeting you—here? He typed.</p>
         <p>Told her something came up. She won't show without me.</p>
         <p>James jammed his phone into his pocket. If it were up to him, he would tell Cassie the
            truth. Lying may have bought him some time from Alexa just now, but serious deception
            never got him anywhere. He lied to protect his mom. Boldfaced lies to his teachers, the
            judge and to himself. He lied until he couldn’t tell the facts from fiction, and it
            didn’t matter anymore.</p>
         <p>After draining his cup, he merged into foot traffic. He got as far as the kitchen
            archway.</p>
         <p>“Hi, James, having a good summer?” Allison Ziegler blocked his way, her hands on her
            hips. She was one of Caleb’s exes. If she wanted to talk to Cal, she needed to pick a
            number.</p>
         <p>“Sure. You?” He tried to inch around her.</p>
         <p>She huffed, “Horrible. I’m stuck in summer school. Is Caleb with you?”</p>
         <p>“He’s out with some ride.” He tried to pass her again.</p>
         <p>“That’s interesting. I’m here with this girl I met in class. She claims she’s dating
            him.”</p>
         <p>He stopped trying to evade her.</p>
         <p>“I think she has the wrong guy because when I tried to clarify—Caleb, tall, blond,
            model, she had no idea what I was talking about. She’s refused to send me a picture, so
            I don’t believe her, but figured I’d see for myself tonight.”</p>
         <p>“What’s your friend’s name?” He held his breath.</p>
         <p>“Cassie Overfield.” She pointed into the kitchen. “Look. She’s over there.”</p>
         <p>The mass of people in the kitchen parted as if on cue. Cassie stood in the middle, under
            the glowing row of fluorescent track lighting, fairer and more delicate than he cared to
            remember.</p>
         <p>Allison punched his shoulder. “Do you know her?”</p>
         <p>Cassie looked around, probably searching for Caleb. Caleb, who dumped her. In slow
            motion, she twisted toward them.</p>
         <p>James dragged Allison around the other side of the column.</p>
         <p>“Oh—Cassie,” he said, “she, uh. She moved into the empty house beside Cal's this
            summer.”</p>
         <p>“So, they're together?” Allison looked at him like he’d lost it.</p>
         <p>“I’m not sure what's going on.” He wasn’t lying. “But Cal’s not showing up here.” Also,
            the truth.</p>
         <p>She grimaced. “I know what you mean by ride, James.”</p>
         <p>Disgust made him say that and now he was sorry. He scratched his chin, half a mind to
            let the whole mess play out, but he would never screw Cal over.</p>
         <p>“About that. Keep it mum. He’s helping a friend—no sex involved.”</p>
         <p>He leaned past Alison and scanned the kitchen. Cassie hadn’t moved. What was she doing
            here? She probably only knew two people—him and Allison.</p>
         <p>“Shite, Allie. Go offer her a drink or something, but don't mention me. She'll be pissed
            Caleb stood her up, and I don't want to answer questions.” Cal owed him big time.
            “Christ, I almost forgot. She doesn’t know about Caleb modeling.”</p>
         <p>Allison’s mouth dropped open. “Why not?”</p>
         <p>He shrugged. “Just go with it.”</p>
         <p>“Does she know anything about you?”</p>
         <p>“Me, no. I don’t want her to, either.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Like he suggested, Allison approached Cassie and handed her a cup. He didn’t expect her
            to drink it, but she did.</p>
         <p>“What are you looking at?” Alexa materialized beside him. She stared into the kitchen,
            then back at James, lips pursed.</p>
         <p>He tapped his empty cup. “Just trying to figure out what to drink.”</p>
         <p>“Isn't that Caleb's girlfriend? I'm surprised you’re not in there, hanging all over
            her.”</p>
         <p>Did he really hang all over Cassie? He got so fucked up when she was around, he had no
            idea if he was coming or going.</p>
         <p>“Forget it.” Alexa rolled her eyes. “You don't need a ride home, do you? Carson wants to
            take me out for drinks.” She held out her phone, messages open.</p>
         <p>“Don't worry about me.” Without glancing at the screen, he pulled out her keys and
            thrust them at her.</p>
         <p>She dropped the phone into her purse. “Why do I waste my time with you?”</p>
         <p>“Don’t know.” He looked away, vaguely aware of Alexa flouncing off.</p>
         <p>Cassie was no longer in the kitchen. He jerked around. Sure enough, she was on the dance
            floor, bumping and grinding with the other girls. At least she wasn't in the corner,
            sobbing.</p>
         <p>The song ended, and a guy, Billy Freeman, handed her another drink. Billy had been in
            his sophomore biology class and puked when they dissected an eyeball. Up till now, he
            didn’t have a problem with the guy.</p>
         <p>Cassie slammed the drink, then resumed dancing.</p>
         <p>Since he couldn’t stay where he was, James poured himself a beer and walked. He ended up
            in the den. Blackjack had become trendy at his school and a bunch of kids gathered
            around a circular card table. The dealer called herself Raven and was another one of
            Caleb’s exes.</p>
         <p>Parker Edison stood when James approached. “Here, dude.” He motioned to his chair. “I'm
            done.”</p>
         <p>James ignored Raven’s sigh; the seat was perfect. If he leaned to the right, he could
            keep an eye on Cassie, but it was unlikely she would notice him. He kept his hood up
            just in case.</p>
         <p>Six rounds later, he hadn’t won a hand and was about to give up his vigil, when the DJ
            played a slow song. Sure enough, Cassie’s snuggled against Billy’s chest.</p>
         <p>“James,” Raven yelled. “You’re up.”</p>
         <p>“Hit me,” he said, without checking his card. He tossed a dollar into the pot then
            leaned forward. Billy’s hands were all over Cassie’s ass.</p>
         <p>Raven dealt him the queen of hearts.</p>
         <p>“Again,” he said, eyes on Cassie. How long was this damn song?</p>
         <p>Raven snorted as she gave him a king. Groaning, James flipped his card. It was a
            jack.</p>
         <p>The long-haired guy on Raven’s right, laughed. “You asked for another card. Are you
            high?” </p>
         <p>He wasn’t high. In fact, he’d been so busy watching Cassie, he was hardly buzzed at
            all.</p>
         <p>The song ended and Cassie sprawled across a chair, drink number five, or was it six, in
            her hand. Billy hung over her, like a horny dog she didn’t shove away.</p>
         <p>Intent on shoving Billy for her, James slid his cards toward Raven. “I’m out.”</p>
         <p>The long-haired guy looped his arm over Raven’s shoulder. “Later, loser.”</p>
         <p>James paused. Getting into a fight on his second night of freedom would drive Caleb
            nuts, but it wasn’t Caleb’s wrath that stopped him. The chair Cassie sat on was empty.
            The need to retaliate at being insulted by some dumbass, slipped to the bottom of his
            priority list.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James found Allison, outside on the deck amongst a group of girls. He grabbed her elbow
            and pulled her away from her friends. “Have you seen Cassie?”</p>
         <p> “I thought you didn't want to see her?” Drunker than the last time they spoke, she
            waved a finger in his face.</p>
         <p>He fumbled for an excuse, not that it mattered because she kept talking. “Is it
            impossible for him to be loyal to one girl?”</p>
         <p>Alcohol had transported Allison back to ninth grade when Caleb screwed around on her,
            and he didn’t have time for it. “Just tell me if you’ve seen Cassie.”</p>
         <p>She puckered her lips. “You two think you are so entitled. You sleep with girls, then
            ditch them—and most of us don't care.”</p>
         <p>“Cassie’s out back.” A girl with a short black bob, joined them, an amethyst stone
            glimmered from her tongue as she spoke. She smiled. “I'm Emily. I sat a row over from
            you in English, last year.”</p>
         <p>“Emmy.” Allison lurched forward. She leaned on Emily for support. “Cassie is dating
            Caleb.”</p>
         <p>Caleb was fucked. Allison was bound to tell Cassie everything she knew about him, but it
            was not his problem.</p>
         <p>“I need to get Cassie,” he said. Surprise widened both their eyes, so he added, “and
            bring her home for Cal.”</p>
         <p>“She’s on the pier.” Emily pointed over the fence. “She claimed she needed air.”</p>
         <p>James turned toward the lake. At the base of each pier, a single lamp post lit sections
            of the beach. After that, the starlit sky bent into the black water.</p>
         <p>A shadowy figure, small in the distance, huddled at the end of the pier. Cassie could
            swim, but she drank—a lot. If she fell and hit her head, she would be a goner. Not
            wanting to fish her dead body out of the lake, he elbowed his way off the deck. He
            bolted through the yard and jumped the fence. A mound of sand against the wooden pickets
            cushioned his landing. He clamored to his feet and headed toward the water. </p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 26</h4>
         <p>James skidded to a halt at the base of the pier and headed back to the house. Now would
            be the time to wipe his hands clean of this whole mess. Why should he care what happened
            to Cassie?</p>
         <p>But he did care. He turned back to the water.</p>
         <p>Shit, he was spinning in circles. He’d been less confused drunk off his ass than he was
            right now stone-cold sober.</p>
         <p>“James, is that you?” Cassie scrambled to her feet. She swayed, close to the edge of the
            dock.</p>
         <p>In anticipation of a rescue dive, James discarded his hoodie and closed the distance. He
            plopped at her feet and patted the wooden planks. “Come on, Cassie, sit for a
            spell.”</p>
         <p>She maneuvered into a sitting position and wiped her eyes. “Do you have any idea where
            Caleb is?”</p>
         <p>“Haven't heard from him all night.” He allowed her to search his face until it became
            unbearable, then shifted his gaze across the water.</p>
         <p>“Liar,” she accused, “you always know where he is.”</p>
         <p>“Not anymore.” Lately, he hardly recognized the guy at all. “I lost track of him when
            you moved next door.”</p>
         <p>They sat silent for a moment then she nudged his shoulder. “Sorry my moving here hurt
            you somehow.”</p>
         <p>Hurt wasn’t the right word. He’d been angry with her at first, but now she exhausted
            him. He laid back, the planks cool under his shirt, and brought his arm over his face.
            The last thing he needed was a girl on his mind twenty-four seven, especially this one.
            Too much shit filled his head already.</p>
         <p>Something soft tickled his elbow. He peeked out. Cassie peered down at him, the ends of
            her hair—golden fleece—brushed his skin.</p>
         <p>“All summer, I’ve been low key begging Caleb to sleep with me.” She hiccupped. “He kept
            refusing. Did he tell you that?”</p>
         <p>James propped himself up on his elbows. “Cal keeps mum on you.”</p>
         <p>“He turned me down flat—until last week. Then. This is the best part. When he wanted to
            have sex, I couldn’t.”</p>
         <p>He sat up. “Why not?”</p>
         <p>“It didn't feel right.”</p>
         <p>Nothing was right about any of this, especially the coy smile accompanying her
            words.</p>
         <p>Scared to pursue another why, he inhaled a deep breath then exhaled slow. “You shouldn’t
            be telling me this. You're not thinking clear right now. You’re fluthered.”</p>
         <p>Her nose crinkled. “English, please.”</p>
         <p>As a child, he’d witnessed dead drunk, puking drunk, angry drunk, and people pissing
            themselves drunk, but fluthered was the worst. It was the type of drunk where his
            stepdad would sit him on his lap and cry. He would pat him on the head and say in a
            broken voice, “I love you, James. I’m extra hard on you so you’ll be better.”</p>
         <p>He glanced to the left where, ten houses down his pier stretched into the night.
            “Fluthered means sloppy drunk.”</p>
         <p>“Are you…fluthered.” She inched closer.</p>
         <p>“You think I'm drunk?”</p>
         <p>She frowned. “You’re at a party full of girls, but here you are, talking to me. You must
            be drunk because you hate me, right?”</p>
         <p>The conversation became dangerous. He stretched his legs over the edge of the dock, the
            souls of his converse skimming the water. “Hate’s a strong word, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>“I saw you watching me.”</p>
         <p>“I wasn’t.”</p>
         <p>“James,” she hiccupped again, “I’m drunk, not blind.”</p>
         <p>Now would be a good time to bring her back to the party—and vanish, but she leaned into
            his side, and walking away seemed impossible.</p>
         <p>“I need to confess,” she said after a few minutes, “I saw you skinny dipping in Caleb’s
            pool.”</p>
         <p>He hmphed. “Did you like what you saw?”</p>
         <p>“I thought you were hot. But I didn’t see the real you then.”</p>
         <p>“If you’ve discovered the real me, you need to get in touch with my shrink. He’s been
            searching forever.”</p>
         <p>She rested her head against his shoulder. “Funny. I found him right away.”</p>
         <p>He loathed fluthered drunks. Half the bullshit they said was spoken on a truthful
            tongue.</p>
         <p>“Do you like me?” she asked, her voice a whisper on the water.</p>
         <p>Like he had the liberty to admit, even to himself, that he might like her. “Cal has
            picked worse chicks,” he said.</p>
         <p>She scoffed, unhappy with his answer and oblivious to the conflict she caused. “So… you
            think I’m pretty?”</p>
         <p>If he only thought she was hot, he’d understand his damn emotions. He got that he wanted
            her on a physical level, but she was in his head, crashing around, plugged into all his
            circuits—and overloading them.</p>
         <p>“Stop asking me shite I can’t answer.” He squeezed her shoulder to take the sting from
            his words. “I feel like my feet are trapped in quicksand most of the time; God only
            knows where my head is. And I like it that way. It’s less painful.”</p>
         <p>It was the truth. Staying messed up made things easy. An excuse. Dr Madison’s words
            floated back to him. You won’t make progress—until you want to.</p>
         <p>He gave her a sideways glance. Her lips turned down—her expression tragic. He waited for
            a sympathetic, bullshit comment, but she offered none. They sat knotted up, under the
            cover of darkness, making anything seem doable.</p>
         <p>She pressed deeper into his side and traced the inseam of his jeans with her thumb,
            tantalizing and tormenting him, at the same time. “The real you, wants me.”</p>
         <p>He couldn’t dispute it.</p>
         <p>“Let’s go for a swim.” She wormed her way out from under his arm and clambered to her
            feet. By the time he joined her, her shirt was half off.</p>
         <p>Laughing, he lowered the material. “No. There is no swimming in tonight’s
            itinerary.”</p>
         <p>Cassie’s chest rose and fell. His need for oxygen aligned with hers. He met her
            gaze.</p>
         <p>“You have such pretty eyes,” she whispered, her own eyes lidded, lashes fluttering. She
            inched closer.</p>
         <p>No longer strong enough to avoid the collision, he placed a cautious kiss on her lips
            and hungrily inhaled her tiny gasp. Then her arms were around him and the smell of smoke
            mingled with the scent of the lake as he buried his head into her neck. </p>
         <p>Fueled by the heat of her skin, he placed a gentle kiss on the spot where her pulse
            beat, then slowly slid his mouth across her cheek where the salty taste of tears
            shattered his pounding heart into a million pieces.</p>
         <p>Her hands slid under the back of his shirt, cool on his flushed body. She could do
            whatever she pleased. The need to kiss her emptied his thoughts and controlled his
            actions. He entwined his fingers into her hair, bringing her closer. For a few minutes,
            no one else existed in the world. Just him, Cassie, and Lake Michigan, its water lapping
            gently against the pier.</p>
         <p>Then he jerked his head up and stepped back. His lips were on Cassie. Caleb’s
            girlfriend—not his. Her dreamy expression lasted a couple of seconds, until the light
            bulb went off, and horror twisted the contentment of her features.</p>
         <p>“Oh, God!” She stumbled backward. “I'm sorry.”</p>
         <p>The mortified expression on her face was his fault. He raked his fingers through his
            hair. “It’s okay. I'm just…I'm just. Fuck. This is banjaxed.”</p>
         <p>Nothing was okay. His universe shifted, and he stood at the brink of some unfixable
            rift. The world as he knew it ended, and all he could think about was kissing her
            again.</p>
         <p>Right or wrong, he reached for her, but she took another step back. Fear clouded her
            eyes.</p>
         <p>“I don't feel good.” She pitched forward and heaved. The contents of her stomach
            splattered his shoes. She puked again, down her shirt, then began to cry.</p>
         <p>Without asking, he scooped her into his arms. He set her down, a pitiful heap, on the
            shore. Her shoulders rocked with soft sobs as she buried her head in her knees.</p>
         <p>“Hold on.” He needed his hoodie. When he got back, she was quiet. “Think you’ll puke
            again?” he asked, squatting to face her.</p>
         <p>She blinked like she couldn’t understand him.</p>
         <p>“Your shirts a sorry mess. It has to come off. You can wear my hoodie.”</p>
         <p>She whimpered as he pulled the neckline of her T-shirt wide beyond repair. She wore a
            lacy bra, for Cal’s benefit, no doubt. Anger jabbed his gut as he fed her arms through
            the sleeves of his hoodie, then zipped her up. He called a taxi, giving them an address
            somewhere between the party’s house number and his own.</p>
         <p> “You need to walk,” he prompted. “I know how to get to the street without anyone seeing
            us.”</p>
         <p>“Are you rescuing me?” she asked, as he led her down a breezeway. “Are you my knight in
            shining armor?”</p>
         <p>“No. Jaysus, Cassie.” No one ever accused him of that.</p>
         <p>How many times had he pulled this stunt on Caleb, getting so messed up he had to be led
            home? Yet Cal remained there for him. The irony was obvious. Sneaking off in a cab with
            Caleb’s girlfriend was not the greatest way to show appreciation.</p>
         <p>He draped his arm over her shoulder and stared out the taxi window as they slipped past
            his house, into the night.</p>
         <p>Solid, warm, and real, Cassie was the one rescuing him. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 27</h4>
         <p>Cassie blinked at the plain gray wall that met the edge of the white-sheeted mattress,
            her skin prickly with sweat. Steady breaths against her back warned her, wherever she
            was, she wasn’t alone.</p>
         <p>She drifted her hand along her body. Underwear on. Shirt on. Careful not to jiggle the
            bed, she rolled over. James lay on his stomach, face tipped to her, features relaxed in
            sleep. A sheet covered his bottom half, but his back was bare.</p>
         <p>Sucking in air, she squeezed her eyelids tight. She was by the lake—with James. At some
            point, she was sure he kissed her.</p>
         <p>“Shit.” She scanned the length of his body. What was she doing in a bed with him?</p>
         <p>His long lashes fluttered, then parted. His eyes widened, and a slow smile tugged at the
            corner of his mouth.</p>
         <p>“Good morning, luv.” He rose onto his elbows, his back curved. “How’s your head. You’re
            not going to puke on me, are you?”</p>
         <p>She navigated into a sitting position and rubbed her eyes. “Tell me I didn't throw up on
            you. And please tell me you're wearing something on your bottom half.”</p>
         <p>“My bottom half is wearing boxer briefs.” He flipped onto his back and his grin grew
            wider. “Good thing too, or you might’ve had your way with me last night.”</p>
         <p>The already hot room became claustrophobic. She clutched her stomach, needing water,
            oxygen—space. The only two windows sat high on the far wall. A thick book held the
            nearest one open but the air remained stagnant.</p>
         <p>“What’s the matter?” James sounded wary. “I’m slagging you, Cassie. You still have your
            panties on, right?”</p>
         <p>She nodded. Using her hand, she tried to create air. “It’s awfully stuffy in here.”</p>
         <p>He leaned forward exposing the ass of his white Calvin Klein underwear, and clicked the
            fan perched on a high wooden stool, between his footboard and dresser. Much needed air
            cooled her damp skin.</p>
         <p>“That should help—and this.” He handed her a glass of water and a pill from the bedside
            table. “It can feel like you’re suffocating in here. Some nights, when it’s a scorcher,
            I walk to the pool house just so I can sleep.”</p>
         <p>The water was warm, but wet. The fan passed over her again and unstuck the hair from her
            neck. She handed the glass back to James. His hair curled into adorable ringlets.</p>
         <p>He grinned. “Stop looking at me like I have two heads.”</p>
         <p>“I never noticed you had such cute curls before.” It was a lie. She noticed every time
            they swam. His sun-dried locks would kick up in soft loops along his neck, the dark
            wisps taking on amber highlights like little licks of flame.</p>
         <p>He pulled at the strands then patted them in place. “Some days I need a damn flat iron
            to tame this mop.”</p>
         <p>Flat iron? The only iron guys in Kansas talked about, was a branding iron. She peeked at
            him, and his honest smile pulled something inside her. “Where are we, anyway?”</p>
         <p>“You're in my apartment. C'ead mi'le fa'ilte.” He motioned about. “Welcome to all of
            this.”</p>
         <p>She surveyed the long rectangular room, searching for an insider's glimpse of James, the
            one that knew about flat irons. The one that told her you can’t force love.</p>
         <p>A black leather sofa heaped with blankets occupied the far corner. An electric guitar
            laid across a coffee table, and a huge metal crucifix hung between a flat-screen TV and
            a closed door.</p>
         <p>He trusted her enough to allow her to invade his privacy. “Does Caleb even know where
            you live?”</p>
         <p>“No one knows. It's how I like it,” he hedged, “and Cal knows better than to press me
            for details.”</p>
         <p>“Why’d you bring me here, then?”</p>
         <p>“You were covered in puke. I couldn’t abandon you in your doorway, and you were mad at
            Cal for standing you up. That crossed off the pool house.”</p>
         <p>Her shoulders slumped with the memory. She’d been such a bitch to Caleb all week, she
            could hardly blame him for avoiding her. “After he told me he couldn't make it, he
            stopped replying to my texts. . . I hope he’s okay.”</p>
         <p>“I'm sure he's fine,” James sounded less than thrilled. “I’ll call him if you want.”</p>
         <p>“No.” The word burst out of her. What would he say? ‘Cassie got too drunk to go home?’
            She would die of humiliation. “It’s okay. I’m meeting him later. I'll get the details
            then.”</p>
         <p>She took a deep breath. “So… this is your family home?”</p>
         <p>“No family. Remember. This is my apartment—in my old foster family’s basement.”</p>
         <p>“Are you close to your foster parents?”</p>
         <p>“Not really. I was almost fourteen when I moved here. I stayed away from them for the
            most part, but they let me stay when I phased out. They didn’t have to.”</p>
         <p>“Phased out?”</p>
         <p>“Transitioned into independent living.” He rolled his eyes. “None of it matters. I
            emancipated myself from my real mom as soon as the law permitted, at sixteen. I'm
            completely on my own.”</p>
         <p>“I didn’t mean to pry.” She always said the wrong thing around him.</p>
         <p>“That's okay, angel.” He fiddled with the sheet. “Does Cal ever say anything about me?
            Stuff about my life?”</p>
         <p>“Not really.” Careful with her words, she needled through her reply. “He hates it when
            he doesn’t know where you are. You should tell him you have a home. It would make him
            feel better.”</p>
         <p>“He knows I have a home. He’s just not sure where it is. Promise you'll keep this a
            secret.”</p>
         <p>She nodded. “So, this is your sanctuary? Where you hide from the world?”</p>
         <p>“Something like that.” His mouth tightened, but the tiny quirk of his eyebrow registered
            surprise.</p>
         <p>“I get it,” she said. After all, she spent almost a year hiding in her bedroom. “We all
            need to disappear sometimes. You're not planning to make me leave with a pillowcase on
            my head, are you?”</p>
         <p>His pinched expression softened. “No pillowcases or blindfolds. Unless you like that
            type of stuff.” He scooted backward, his back against the headboard. The sheet slipped
            down to his thighs. “I guess this makes us cohorts.”</p>
         <p>Pillowcases… cohorts... something… She nodded to be agreeable, but her eyes drifted to
            the lump under the yoked front of his snug, white boxer briefs and the way his stomach
            flattened between his hip bones. His stomach tattoo teased her. She only got to see half
            of that darn thing.</p>
         <p>He tugged the sheet up. “Relax. You are only a few blocks from your house. You'll see
            when you leave.”</p>
         <p>“You live close.” The fan jet streamed another blast of much-needed coolness over her
            flushed skin. “That explains your random appearances.”</p>
         <p>“That's me.” He shut his eyes. “All about being arbitrary.”</p>
         <p>He was being nice. Too nice. “How come you're being so sweet? Say something shitty.”</p>
         <p>“You want me to be mean to you?” He gave her a hard stare.</p>
         <p>“Come on, James, you know you want to.”</p>
         <p>His eyes narrowed. “You’re pretty with your hair all messed up.”</p>
         <p>“Thanks.”</p>
         <p>“You're welcome, angel.” His gaze drifted to her chest. “My tee looks hot on you
            too.”</p>
         <p>She looked down. The words Red Hot Chili Peppers emblazoned the front of the shirt—not
            the clothes she’d dressed in the night before.</p>
         <p>“You should see your expression right now.” He chuckled. “I've been waiting for you to
            notice. I'm disappointed in your powers of observation.”</p>
         <p>“Did you undress me?” she asked, her voice rising.</p>
         <p>“Hush.” He pressed a finger to his lips. “Maury undressed you—and cleaned you up. She
            fed you two aspirins and even got you to brush your teeth. A new toothbrush of course.”
            James shook his head. “I can't believe you don't remember. You had an illuminating
            conversation with her about cats.”</p>
         <p>Cats? What the heck? The last part of the evening was a blur. “Who's Maury?”</p>
         <p>“She lives upstairs. Her name’s actually Maureen, and she loves me to death.” He
            shrugged like he couldn’t explain his appeal.</p>
         <p>“Really?” Caleb never mentioned anyone named Maureen. “Why didn't she visit you in the
            hospital?”</p>
         <p>“What makes you think she didn't?” He beamed. “Where do you think I got the smokes?”</p>
         <p>And probably the pills. She decidedly did not like Maury. Besides, how important could
            she be to James if Caleb didn't know she existed? Her stomach twisted. Who was this
            girl?</p>
         <p>James’ expression turned contemplative. “She and Cal are the only people I consider
            family.”</p>
         <p>His emphasis on the word family made it clear Maury was not a romantic prospect, but why
            he felt the need to explain their relationship was beyond her. Her cheeks heated. He was
            too close, being too candid. He was too naked.</p>
         <p>“You kissed me last night?” She had to know for sure.</p>
         <p>His gaze remained steady. “I did.”</p>
         <p>“Did I like it?”</p>
         <p>His shoulders rose, a tiny shrug illustrating his uncertainty. He tilted his head and
            allowed his hair to obscure his smile. “I think so.”</p>
         <p>Without thought, she touched the silky strands. The soft ends curled around her fingers
            and entertained her fingertips.</p>
         <p>“I can do it again. Kiss you, that is.” He sighed.</p>
         <p>Warm breath spilled across her hand, sending a wave of heat up her arm. She let her hand
            drop and gave him a slight nod. Eyes closed, she waited, her heartbeat pounding in her
            ears.</p>
         <p>The bed creaked. His hand grazed her elbow and his breath fell hot on her cheek. “Open
            your eyes,” he whispered. “I want you to know who's kissing you.”</p>
         <p>That was not an issue. Every inch of her being, was aware who sat next to her.</p>
         <p>His lips feathered her cheek, moving downward until he reached her mouth. He paused, so
            close. What was he waiting for?</p>
         <p>His lips touched hers, warm then hot, then, like an explosion, hotter. The planet
            stopped spinning.</p>
         <p>Kissing him was like getting oxygen or eating candy. He made her greedy. She wanted more
            and she wanted it now. Arms around his neck, she pushed her mouth against his,
            demanding.</p>
         <p>He broke away, eyes wide, mouth wet with evidence of her hunger—and her breath caught.
            This was not the James she saw every day, the confident one, sure of everything he said
            and did. Right now, he looked as though he wouldn’t know his name, if someone asked
            him.</p>
         <p>No one ever looked at her that way. Not Caleb, or anybody back in Kansas.</p>
         <p>He jerked forward, shifting on top of her, his mouth on hers, his hand under her shirt.
            Every place he touched exploded, a series of fireworks. She moaned. Loud.</p>
         <p>Embarrassed, she pushed him back. Her brain scrambled, their legs a tangled mess, tied
            up in the sheet.</p>
         <p>With a loud groan, James flopped back on the mattress and flipped onto his belly,
            turning his head away from her. His back rose and fell at a rapid pace.</p>
         <p>“That was interesting,” he said, after a minute. He faced her. “Do you kiss Cal like
            that?”</p>
         <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
         <p>“I don't know. Dissolve in his arms.”</p>
         <p>“Is there something wrong with how I kiss?” She did dissolve in his arms, and now he
            mocked her.</p>
         <p>He groaned again.</p>
         <p>“Sorry if I'm a bad kisser.” Tears formed in her eyes. How could she be so turned on
            when he was so repulsed?</p>
         <p>“Christ.” His hand brushed her thigh under the sheet. “You're not a bad kisser. But
            you're not mine to kiss.”</p>
         <p>Her heart fluttered. “You like kissing me?”</p>
         <p>“I do.” James rolled to his back and propped himself up on his elbows. “I can illustrate
            if you don't believe me.” Grinning, he got to his feet.</p>
         <p>Stretched under the tight material of his boxer briefs, and pressed against his stomach,
            laid one hundred percent proof he liked her kiss. A blanket of heat engulfed her. Across
            her face and between her legs.</p>
         <p>“Good. I've rendered you speechless, just how I like my women.” With a wicked smile, he
            crawled toward her until he hovered over her body.</p>
         <p>“Stop. You're freaking me out.” She put her hands out. It was supposed to be a firm
            refusal, but his grin was adorable.</p>
         <p>“I’m just demonstrating what your lips did. You're lucky, angel, I usually sleep in the
            nip.”</p>
         <p>She locked her elbows. Caleb never pulled anything like this. No one did. And even if
            they had, no one had ever had this effect on her. It was like fighting a gravitational
            pull.</p>
         <p>“How many girls have you cornered like this?” She tried to laugh.</p>
         <p>“None. Scratch that. One. You.”</p>
         <p>“Why me?”</p>
         <p>“I'm guessing you want an honest answer.” He pulled back and looked her in the eyes.
            “Because you believe me and trust me. And you don't treat me like a colossal fuck up.”
            He answered fast, like he already considered it. His lips found her neck and cruised
            downward. “Don’t make me think right now.”</p>
         <p>Intent on remaining semi-upright, she dug her elbows into the mattress. She didn’t want
            to end up flat on the bed with him on top of her. The exact position she could tell he
            wanted her in.</p>
         <p>He slid down, his head against her stomach and nosed her shirt out of the way, his lips
            wet on her belly. His fingers slid into position along her outer thighs, under the legs
            of her panties. One tiny pull would remove them.</p>
         <p>“Stop,” she managed, breathing hard, her hands on his head. The pounding between her
            legs threatened to control her. James was like a tidal wave, and she could easily get
            sucked into his undertow.</p>
         <p>His ragged breath blanketed her belly and left her trembling.</p>
         <p>“I would have stopped without your prompting.” Appearing chastised, he sat up. “Don’t
            worry. I’m not interested in mowing Cal’s grass.”</p>
         <p>Eyes downcast, he lingered for a second then got off the bed. “I’ll be in the shower if
            you need me.” He disappeared through the door beside the crucifix, leaving her
            spellbound.</p>
         <p>She stared, open-mouthed at the closed door. Holy crap. What was up with him?</p>
         <p>What was up with her?</p>
         <p>She never responded to a guy like that. She needed to get out of there before she
            zombied-out and appeared naked in his bathroom.</p>
         <p>With no idea where her things were, she opened the top drawer of James’ dresser. She
            borrowed a pair of track pants and pulled the string tight. Her shoes had been
            thoughtfully placed beside the bed; her phone tucked neatly in the left.</p>
         <p>Dressed in head-to-toe, James felt intimate. She knew what color his sheets were and
            checked out his personal stuff. He shared this part of his life with her, not Caleb.</p>
         <p>But James wasn’t thinking about intimacy. It was unlikely he’d been thinking at all.
            This may be a big deal to her, but it meant nothing to him. He likes all his girls
            speechless, he said. That put things into perspective.</p>
         <p>She needed security, not heartbreak.</p>
         <p>She squeezed between the fan and the dresser and carefully opened the door. The rest of
            the basement was unfinished and contained two staircases. The nearest staircase, next to
            the washer and dryer, went up four steps then turned, making it impossible to see what
            waited at the top. Daylight streamed down the second set of stairs. They led her into a
            small backyard.</p>
         <p>James hadn’t been joking when he said she was close to home. As soon as she rounded his
            house, she recognized Saint Ambrose on the corner. His scent lingered in her hair. His
            detergent. His toothpaste. His bed…</p>
         <p>She needed a shower, and a memory wiping. If she didn’t get her crap together before she
            met up with Caleb, she would start the new school year, single. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 28</h4>
         <p>In the middle of his shower, James’ phone went off. He shook his hand free of water and
            scrambled for it before it vibrated off the tank, into the toilet.</p>
         <p>He hit speaker without checking the display. “Talk.”</p>
         <p>Caleb chuckled on the other end. “So polite.”</p>
         <p>In an instant, he slid across the tiled floor to peek through the bathroom door. His bed
            was an empty mass of rumpled sheets. Cassie was gone.</p>
         <p>He breathed a sigh of relief. Sleeping next to her had been frustrating, but it was a
            dick move to trap her on his bed. He never chased Cal’s chicks and didn’t plan to start
            now.</p>
         <p>“Cal. Still there?” He closed the toilet lid and sat down.</p>
         <p>“You alone?” Caleb asked after a short pause.</p>
         <p>“Completely.” Blinking, he rubbed soap out of his left eye. “I’m at home.”</p>
         <p>“Good. I’m meeting Cassie in an hour, and you have to be there.”</p>
         <p>He didn’t want to see either of them. “Why?”</p>
         <p>“I stood her up. Remember? Red across town?” Caleb sighed. “James, are you following me?
            Last night’s party… Are you all right?”</p>
         <p>“I remember. Fuck.” Why did everyone assume he was having a mental breakdown if he
            didn't answer right away? Shivering, he reached into the shower and adjusted the water
            to hot. “Text me your location.”</p>
         <p>This had bad scene written all over it, and he had no one to blame but himself.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“You owe me eighteen bucks.” James plunked into the chair across from Caleb and sipped
            his coffee.</p>
         <p>Caleb pulled his wallet out. “What for?”</p>
         <p>“Taxi.”</p>
         <p>“Something wrong with your car?” Caleb tossed a twenty onto the table.</p>
         <p>“It would have taken time to park, and I got the impression you wanted me here fast.
            Twenty minutes ago, I was in my shower. That's fast.” Having been joking about the cash,
            he pushed the bill toward Caleb. “Where were you yesterday?”</p>
         <p>Caleb put the money back in his wallet and grinned. “I got to know Red really, really
            well. The rug matches the drapes, by the way.”</p>
         <p>“You shagged her?” Until now, he hadn’t been sure Cal would go through with it.</p>
         <p>“Shh.” Caleb looked around. “Three times, bro. Although, the last time was, in your
            words, feckin futile.”</p>
         <p>Unsure of what his expression should project, James leaned back. Cal appeared pleased,
            but congratulations seemed a stretch.</p>
         <p>“You’re breaking up with Cassie, then?” he asked. That would make it easier to avoid
            her. Problem solved.</p>
         <p>“No. I’m not breaking up with her. What’s with you?” Suspicion narrowed Caleb’s eyes. A
            look James wasn’t used to being on the receiving end of.</p>
         <p>He folded his arms in front of him. “What do you mean?”</p>
         <p>“You keep asking about Cassie.”</p>
         <p>“I do?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, dude. At the beach, and just now. It never bothered you before when I wasn’t
            faithful.”</p>
         <p>Cal was right. They used to laugh about his affairs. James twisted his Cubs hat around,
            the brim low over his eyes and glowered. How in the hell had he developed this annoying,
            moral rectitude toward Cal’s girlfriend?</p>
         <p>“So, what’s your problem?” Caleb’s frown deepened. You've done two girls—at the same
            time.”</p>
         <p>True. On more than one occasion. James laced his fingers behind his head. “But I wasn’t
            supposed to be into one of them. For me, it’s just sex. All the time. You said you
            wanted a girlfriend this summer. Something serious.”</p>
         <p>“I do want a girlfriend.” Caleb sounded exasperated. “I’m waiting for her to change her
            mind back, into wanting to sleep with me again. Isn't that what you’re supposed to do in
            a relationship? Wait?”</p>
         <p>The entire conversation was ludicrous, and the fact that he had to pull it out of Cal
            was infuriating. “I'm pretty sure, in a relationship, you're not supposed to screw
            another girl because you're trying to be a gentleman with the first one. Even I
            understand that much, Cal.” He sighed. “Graʹ leat iʹ?”</p>
         <p>“Do I love her?” Caleb issued a noncommittal shrug. “It’s different with her. Are you
            okay with this?”</p>
         <p>“Since when do you need my permission?”</p>
         <p>“I know you think she’s a pain in the ass.” Caleb shook his head. “Just get any idea
            that I'm putting Cassie above you, out of your head. I would never do that. Not with any
            chick.”</p>
         <p>That was how he’d felt. Left behind for the first girl that might be worthy of being
            abandoned for.</p>
         <p>“Then why do you keep me in the dark when it comes to her?” The question burnt him for
            some time, but he never planned to ask it. He fought to read Caleb’s reaction, but
            everything blurred. His heart pounded, his muscles twitched, and the metallic taste of
            cortisol filled his mouth.</p>
         <p>He traced the rim of his cup with his thumb, his thoughts a slippery, evasive mess. No
            matter how he examined the situation, the ground beneath his feet caved in. He was mad
            at Cal for having Cassie, mad at himself for wanting her, and most confusing, mad at her
            for consuming all Cal’s attention.</p>
         <p>Unsure how much time passed, he looked up. All color had drained from Caleb’s
            cheeks.</p>
         <p>“James. I was talking to you. Stay with me, dude. It freaks me out when you detach like
            that.”</p>
         <p>“I'm here, man. Relax.”</p>
         <p>Caleb sighed. “So, you feel like you’re in the dark—”</p>
         <p>“Don't pull that counseling bullshit on me.” James bristled. “I don't feel like I’m in
            the dark, it’s a feckin fact. What’s the deal with you two? Your lips are sealed when it
            comes to her. I’m an outsider.”</p>
         <p>For a second Caleb looked away, then he nodded. “I wanted to have a secret from you. I'm
            not sure why, but I’m sorry.”</p>
         <p>James leaned back, his chair on its hind legs. He knew why. Because, despite the whole
            Red travesty, and for whatever reason, Caleb wanted Cassie and didn’t want to admit
            it.</p>
         <p>He wanted to throw his drink.</p>
         <p>“Okay,” Caleb’s voice sounded miles away and on high alert, “I’ll tell you everything
            from now on.”</p>
         <p>James gripped the edge of the table and let his thoughts jumble. He wasn’t supposed to
            retreat into his head, but the possibility of throwing his cup was too real if he came
            back to Earth right now.</p>
         <p>“Hey, guys.”</p>
         <p>Cassie’s voice brought him back.</p>
         <p>Her lips were pressed tight, her eyes large. But then, so were Caleb's.</p>
         <p>He wanted to tell Cal he was okay. “Angel,” came out instead.</p>
         <p>Cassie’s cheeks pinkened. She fumbled with her purse.</p>
         <p>Caleb turned. “Hey, Cassie. Thanks for meeting us.” Jumping to attention, he hugged her
            then pulled out a chair. “I’ll go get your coffee.” He mouthed 'be nice' over her head
            before leaving.</p>
         <p>“Great,” James said when she pulled out her phone. “You can't even look at me.”</p>
         <p>“What are you doing here?” she asked in an exaggerated whisper.</p>
         <p>“You have a problem with me being here?” It wasn’t funny, but he chuckled. “You didn’t
            have a problem with me this morning.”</p>
         <p>Her expression withered, making him regret his words. “Cal called. He figured you’d be
            pissed at being stood up and wanted me here as a buffer.”</p>
         <p>“Did he tell you where he was?”</p>
         <p>James eyed the coffee line; Cal would be awhile. He shook his head. “Nope.” And since it
            sounded like she needed a reminder, he added, “He has no idea where you were either. I'd
            like to keep it that way.”</p>
         <p>She sucked in her top lip and nodded. “I'm sorry about last night. The whole puke thing.
            I know you were being nice because you felt sorry for me. I’ve decided it would be in
            both our best interests to give you an out.”</p>
         <p>“An out?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah.” She watched him, closely. “You can stop pretending to like me.”</p>
         <p>James set his coffee down and feigned a yawn. “That’s a bloody relief.”</p>
         <p>“So we can just go back to being…” She dipped her head, “…frenemies? Or whatever we
            were.”</p>
         <p>Cal had reached the register. “Caleb knows what you drink?”</p>
         <p>“Yes. Sure. We get coffee almost every day. So, are we friends… sort of?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah, frenemies.” Whatever the hell that was. Was she fucking serious? He scrolled
            through his contacts. There had to be some female close by. One who could meet him right
            now. Someone to erase the visual of Cal and her having their morning coffee, talking
            like a lovely married couple.</p>
         <p>Caleb joined them. He handed Cassie a tall, iced drink covered in whipped cream. “Just
            how you like it.”</p>
         <p>“How very sweet of you, Cal,” James said, concentrating on his phone.</p>
         <p>Caleb placed his arm around Cassie. “Did you miss me last night? I’m sorry I couldn’t
            make it.”</p>
         <p>James dropped his phone onto the table and rolled his eyes. “Oh, Cassie. Did you miss
            me, baby?” he mimicked, cutting off Cassie’s reply.</p>
         <p>His stomach hurt. Unable to sit still, he picked up a couple of stir sticks and tapped
            out a percussion solo on the cup lid.</p>
         <p>“What are you doing?” Caleb sounded pissed. “James!”</p>
         <p>Groaning, James tossed the sticks on the table. They slid across the surface, stopping
            against Cassie’s cup.</p>
         <p>She stared at him, open-mouthed.</p>
         <p>“Don’t worry, Cassandra.” He picked up his phone. “I’ll be out of your hair soon.”</p>
         <p>Caleb cleared his throat, something he did when he was stressed. “You don’t have to go
            anywhere. Hang with us…” He cleared his throat again. “What do you want to do,
            Cassie?”</p>
         <p>She leaned forward and whispered something in Caleb’s ear; the secret punctuated with
            tiny laugh and a slight blush. Her hand moved under the table and Caleb’s brows shot
            up.</p>
         <p>It was a move James would have expected from Alexa, not Cassie. He pushed out of his
            chair. “I can't believe you just giggled. That's so daft. What are you, twelve?”</p>
         <p>“Stoptar suas!” Caleb stood. “You're out of line.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever, Cal. You can't possibly want that.” He wanted to hurt her. Screw them both to
            hell.</p>
         <p>Cassie gasped.</p>
         <p>Caleb grabbed James’ arm and squeezed it hard. Tight enough to make it hurt. The people
            at the next table stopped talking.</p>
         <p>“You're making a scene,” James said. He couldn’t remember the last time they’d been this
            angry with one another. “You actually look like you want to puck me right now.”</p>
         <p>Caleb released him. “Follow me,” he said then headed toward the bathroom. Scooping his
            phone, James followed.</p>
         <p>“What the hell is the matter with you?” Caleb checked the stalls then turned. “First,
            you zone out on me, which by the way, scares the crap out of me. Then you freaking
            implode all over Cassie. I don't get it. Did I do something to you? Did she?”</p>
         <p>James slammed the door on the handicap stall. It made a satisfying crack before it
            bounced back to him. “I just want to get the hell out of here. Away from you.”</p>
         <p>“Why?” Crinkles formed around Caleb’s eyes, replacing the anger. “Talk to me.”</p>
         <p>“Because...” Damn it. He didn’t know why. “Because first you try to analyze me, and now
            you've sequestered me in the jacks. Cassie's waiting. Go on, run to her.”</p>
         <p>Caleb leaned on the sink, his confusion reflected in the mirror. “This is about Cassie?
            What do you want me to do? I feel horrible for last night. I want to make it up to her,
            but I don't want to fight with you.”</p>
         <p>James slammed the stall door again, but not with as much fervor. He sank onto his
            haunches and rested his head on his knees.</p>
         <p>“All right.” Caleb spoke into the mirror. “If it's bugging you so much, we can drop
            Cassie off and go somewhere. Just you and me.”</p>
         <p>“Great. You only want to hang with me because you're scared I’ll do something crazy.
            Stay with Cassie. I promise I won't overdose, no drinking and driving, and, oh yeah, I
            won't get into any fights. I have a booking tomorrow. I couldn't get wasted tonight if I
            wanted to.”</p>
         <p>Caleb faced him. “Where are you sleeping?”</p>
         <p>“Who knows?” James mumbled, then the full meaning of Caleb’s words hit home. “Don’t
            worry, I'll stay clear of the pool house.” He cracked his knuckles. “Use a Johnny, will
            ya?”</p>
         <p>Nodding, Caleb made his way to the urinals. “She may flake on me, but if she doesn’t,
            you’ll be the first to know.”</p>
         <p>“Cool.” James headed for the door. “Sorry 'bout the meltdown.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie checked her phone. What were they doing in the bathroom? Surely not discussing
            where she spent the night. James wouldn’t do that to her—or himself. She pushed her
            drink away. If someone didn't come out within five minutes, she planned to go in after
            them.</p>
         <p>James slinked out first. He walked past her like she didn't exist. A lump formed in her
            throat. Caleb’s eyes met hers as he ambled across the room.</p>
         <p>“Hey.” He looped his arm around her. “You okay? Did James say something else?”</p>
         <p>She snuggled into Caleb’s side. “He didn’t talk to me at all.”</p>
         <p>“He can be such a jackass sometimes. I'm sorry you have to put up with him.”</p>
         <p>She angled herself to face him. “What did you guys talk about? Did you tell him to be
            nice to me?”</p>
         <p>Caleb winced. “I'm sure you noticed it’s impossible to make James do anything he doesn’t
            want to. But yeah, the conversation went something like that.”</p>
         <p>“Where's he going?”</p>
         <p>“My guess. To get laid. Speaking of messing around… I'm curious what brought that
            comment on earlier. The one you whispered in my ear. You’ve been so unsure lately.”</p>
         <p>“Maybe I think it’s time.” Her gaze drifted toward the doors at the far end of the
            restaurant.</p>
         <p>“This has nothing to do with me standing you up last night, does it? I wouldn't want you
            to do something out of, I don't know, fear of losing me.”</p>
         <p>“Fear of losing you.” She rolled her eyes. “Should I be?”</p>
         <p>He kissed her forehead. “I'm not going anywhere.” </p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 29</h4>
         <p>Even with the air on in the pool house, the hair stuck to the back of Cassie’s neck. She
            swiveled the ice around her glass. It had all but disappeared, and the setting sun had
            done little to cool the temperature.</p>
         <p>She set the glass down and glanced at the clock. What was Caleb doing in the main house?
            He said he’d be five minutes, not fifteen.</p>
         <p>The door opened, and Caleb stepped in, dressed in white cotton pajama pants. Nothing
            else. His stomach muscles tightened, rippling his tanned skin as he lowered himself
            beside her, onto the sofa.</p>
         <p>“Ah, that’s better.” He motioned to his lack of attire. “Clothing needs to come off when
            it’s this hot.”</p>
         <p>Was that her cue to undress? It would be easier if he came right out and said something.
            A trail of fine, blond fuzz disappeared under his waistband. She was sure he wasn’t
            wearing anything underneath.</p>
         <p>“You’re staring at me,” he said, his gaze on the television. The light from the screen
            flickered across his features.</p>
         <p>“I'm envious.” It was doubtful he could hear the quiver in her voice. “Guys have such an
            advantage, being able to go topless.”</p>
         <p>A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. “What's stopping you?”</p>
         <p>That was unquestionably an invitation, and nothing was stopping her. Determined, she
            unbuttoned her shirt, working from the top down. It was no big deal. Her bra looked like
            a bathing suit, right? That's what James insisted when they ended up in the pool
            together, the sun rising around them.</p>
         <p>James.</p>
         <p>Guilt pinched her. He’d already seen her in her bra.</p>
         <p>She popped open the last two buttons. The silky material slid over her shoulders to the
            floor.</p>
         <p>“Hold on.” Caleb got up to lock the door then rejoined her on the sofa. He motioned for
            her to come closer, so she climbed on top and straddled his legs. He rested his hands on
            either side of her thighs, his eyes on her.</p>
         <p>Hands shaking, she reached back to unclasp her bra. The garment dropped to his lap and
            her breasts spilled out. Chilly conditioned air accosted her damp skin. She shivered as
            her nipples reacted to the temperature change.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s wide eyes rewarded her actions. His chest rose with his throaty inhale, but he
            didn’t touch her. Instead, he pulled a blanket from the back of the sofa and draped it
            over her shoulders.</p>
         <p>“You don't want me?” she teased, surprised by the seductiveness in her tone. She ground
            her bottom into his groin.</p>
         <p>Moaning, he traced the curve of her legs until his hands were under her shorts. He
            squeezed her butt. “I want you. Believe me.”</p>
         <p>From where she sat, it was obvious he wanted her. She continued to push against him,
            enjoying the sensation building between her legs and his breath, hot on her breasts.
            This wasn’t so bad. She had more control than she imagined. Caleb looked powerless right
            now.</p>
         <p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” He gripped her hips and stopped her from moving. “If
            you don’t, you need to stop what you're doing.”</p>
         <p>“I want to,” she said, as if in a trance. If they didn’t start soon, she might change
            her mind.</p>
         <p>Surprising her with his strength, he picked her up and flipped her on her back,
            sandwiching her between him and the sofa. He undid the button on her waistband and slid
            her shorts and panties past her hips, to her ankles.</p>
         <p>Any control she thought she had, disappeared. His lips pressed down on hers, his hands
            roamed her body. Caleb was a good kisser, but her thoughts scattered. She couldn’t
            concentrate enough to enjoy him.</p>
         <p>Being under him, against the cushioned back of the sofa made it hard to breathe. She
            fought the claustrophobic urge to push him off. That wouldn’t accomplish anything. She
            needed to do this. Sex would make them a couple.</p>
         <p>She slipped her hand under the front of his waistband and grasped his penis but didn’t
            know what to do with it. He grunted. She wasn’t sure if it was out of pleasure or pain.
            Or if he was turned on, or off, by her awkward exploration.</p>
         <p>He buried his head in her neck, shoulders against hers as he lowered his pants.</p>
         <p>Things were proceeding faster than she expected, but she had no idea how to slow them
            down, or what she was supposed to be doing. Would it be rude to say, ‘stop, let me
            examine your parts?’ The thought made her chuckle.</p>
         <p>“Are you laughing at me?” Caleb propped himself up on his elbows, chuckling as well.</p>
         <p>The foot of space between them allowed her to suck in more air and examine his face. He
            put up with her confusion and gave her time to come to this herself. She loved the
            serenity he brought into her life. He deserved this, especially after her recent error
            in judgment.</p>
         <p>He placed a soft kiss on her hand before laying it across her chest. His fingers trailed
            down her skin till they were between her legs. She gasped. Someone else’s hand down
            there felt alien.</p>
         <p>“It's okay.” He smiled against her lips. “I don't want to hurt you. This will help.”</p>
         <p>It didn’t. The idea seemed sexy, but his prodding fingers felt gigantic. And they were
            little in comparison to his penis. How would that ever fit in there?</p>
         <p>Giving up, Caleb maneuvered his body between her legs.</p>
         <p>Her heart pounded in her ears. Breathe. Relax. Breathe. She lifted her pelvis and
            wiggled, hoping it would help him somehow.</p>
         <p>After a few failed attempts, just when she thought it wasn’t going to happen, her body
            accepted him. It pinched when he entered, but there was no real pain. She brought her
            hand down to feel if he was all the way in. It was hard to tell, but based on his
            labored breathing and thrusting motions, it seemed to be working.</p>
         <p>This was happening. She wrapped her arms around his back, and let Caleb do his
            thing.</p>
         <p>After a few minutes, he slipped out and crouched over her. He did something she couldn't
            see, then slumped against the sofa, breathing hard.</p>
         <p>It was over. She pulled her knees together and waited, unsure what to do. Tears filled
            her eyes. She wasn't a virgin anymore. She brought her arm over her face to hide.</p>
         <p>Hiding behind his arm was something James did. She choked back a sob.</p>
         <p>Caleb nudged her knee. “The first time’s rough.” His breathing evened out, and he wiped
            his hands off with his pajama pants. “I promise it will get better.”</p>
         <p>She let him tuck the sheet around her. “I’m just kind of sad. It’s like I've
            changed.”</p>
         <p>“You have changed in a way.” He stood up, right in front of her. She shied away. Now
            that the moment passed, she craved space.</p>
         <p>“If it makes you feel better, that was a first for me too.” He pulled a pair of
            underwear out of the pile of laundry. “I’ve never had sex without a condom.”</p>
         <p>Damn. Where had her brain disappeared to? She’d rehearsed this scene so many times in
            her head, and it always involved a condom.</p>
         <p>“It's okay.” Caleb stood at the end of the sofa, still holding his underwear. “I came in
            my hand. I think that's why I went so quick. Skin on skin was way more intense.” He
            studied her for a second. “I’m going to shower. Is that okay?”</p>
         <p>It was more than okay. She nodded, happy to get dressed without his prying eyes.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Alone, she lifted the sheet and used the leg of his pajamas to clean up. Everything
            looked the same but it wasn’t.</p>
         <p>Caleb called the experience intense, but not for her. It had been okay, maybe even
            pleasant after he’d made it in and found his rhythm. But she was glad it was over. Where
            were the goosebumps, the burning desire? Pleasant was okay, but was it enough?</p>
         <p>She dressed in her shorts but passed Caleb’s clean laundry pile to slip on a T-shirt out
            of James’ drawer. She drew the bottom of it up to wipe her eyes and was immersed in his
            scent. The heat, absent in her encounter with Caleb, rushed through her.</p>
         <p>She twisted her fingers in the hem of James’ T-shirt. </p>
         <p>Next time would be better.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>The door rattled, followed by frantic pounding. Cassie removed Caleb’s arm from her
            stomach and stretched for her phone. It was three in the morning. They’d fallen asleep
            on the sofa.</p>
         <p>“Wake up.” She shook Caleb. “Someone’s pounding.”</p>
         <p>Groaning he rubbed his eyes. He staggered to the door in his briefs and unlocked it.</p>
         <p>The door burst open. James tripped over the threshold, a blonde girl under his arm. His
            eyes floated over Cassie. “I knew you'd be here.”</p>
         <p>Caleb headed back to the sofa. “Then why are you here?” He pulled on a pair of shorts,
            under the girl’s hungry eyes. “Tell me you’re not driving?”</p>
         <p>“Uber,” James said. He dropped into the big armchair and pulled the girl on top of him.
            “Everybody, this is Roxanne. Roxanne is....”</p>
         <p>“Need an adjective,” Cassie mumbled.</p>
         <p>“Not twelve,” James fired back. He twisted around Roxanne to grin, but his smile faded
            as his gaze swept over Cassie’s chest. “Tell me you didn't have sex in my shirt?”</p>
         <p>“James.” Caleb motioned toward the kitchen alcove. “Talk. Now.”</p>
         <p>Shaking his head, James waved him off. “No more talk, Callie. I'm just here ‘cause I
            need a place to get my hole.” He kissed the back of Roxanne’s neck and slid his hand
            under her top.</p>
         <p>His hole? That was the rudest thing Cassie ever heard. Worse, Roxanne didn't seem to
            care. She turned to kiss him. Passionate kisses, her tongue in his mouth, her hands in
            his hair.</p>
         <p>Cassie couldn't look away.</p>
         <p>They parted long enough for James to slip his shirt over his head. He threw the shirt at
            Cassie. “Since you like my feckin clothing so much.”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s cheeks reddened. “Your stuff fits her better than mine.”</p>
         <p>“I don’t want your stinky shirt.” Cassie threw it back, but his lips were back on
            Roxanne’s, his eyes shut.</p>
         <p>Shifting, James yanked open the button of his jeans. “Want my feckin trousers, too? Roxy
            only wants what’s in them.”</p>
         <p>It should have been funny, but it wasn’t.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s mouth dropped open. “Holy fuck. James, stop. What are you trying to prove?”</p>
         <p>“Come on, baby.” James stood abruptly and Roxanne scrambled to her feet. Her fingers
            skimmed the bulge in his pants.</p>
         <p>Cassie wanted to shake her. Didn’t she care that he was out of it? It was unlikely he’d
            even remember her in the morning.</p>
         <p>James grabbed Roxanne’s wrist and led her to the bedroom. He reappeared seconds later
            and rummaged through the top cabinet drawer. He waved a foiled package at Cassie. “You
            know what these are? Don't you, luv?”</p>
         <p>“Caleb,” she batted her lashes at him, “you swore you didn’t have any condoms.” James
            could read that however he wanted.</p>
         <p>For a second James stood there, looking every bit as sick as she felt. Then he
            disappeared into the bedroom, slamming the door so hard the pictures shook.</p>
         <p>“I never said I didn’t have condoms.” Caleb chuckled. “I’m always on him about using
            them—especially when he's slumming.”</p>
         <p>“Slumming?”</p>
         <p>Caleb flipped stations, his ears red. “You know what he’s like.”</p>
         <p>She saw enough of James to know he mastered smoke screens and obnoxious comebacks. But
            how could anybody truly know someone who didn’t seem to understand themselves?</p>
         <p>“What?” Caleb sighed. “I'm just happy he didn't put the condom on right in front of
            us.”</p>
         <p>“Would you have stopped him?” She doubted it.</p>
         <p>He huffed. “Look Cassie, there’s something going on with him, he's not telling me, but
            when I figure it out, I'll make it right.” He motioned between the two of them. “I think
            he’s jealous of the time I spend with you.”</p>
         <p>“Maybe,” she said as laughter emanated from the back room. Laughter. What was he doing?
            “Do you mind if I go home?” she asked, already on her feet.</p>
         <p>“Whatever you want.” Caleb glanced at the bedroom door. “Want me to walk you?”</p>
         <p>“I'm okay.” For once, her bedroom would be a solace, not a prison.</p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 30</h4>
         <p>The taxi screeched to a halt a couple of blocks from James’ house. The driver twisted in
            his seat. “Get out!”</p>
         <p>He continued to spew a fountain of verbiage, none of which James understood, but the
            shaking fist meant the odds were good, the guy wanted to deck him.</p>
         <p>James opened the door, and a gust of wind infiltrated the taxi. Bent trees waved their
            branches, creating frantic shadows in the darkness. In his current state, he’d never
            make the two blocks home before the storm hit. Perhaps he should have refrained from
            stating the cute brown-haired girl in the photo stuck to the dash, would look hot
            sucking his huge Irish mickey.</p>
         <p>He tossed a fifty on the front seat. “Aw. Come on.”</p>
         <p>“Jow.” The driver picked up his phone. “I call the police.”</p>
         <p>“Cuir do ghuthán ar shiúl. Asshole.” James glared at him in the mirror. The dude wasn’t
            the only one able to speak a foreign language. “No cops. I’m leaving.”</p>
         <p>He spilled onto the sidewalk and tried to slam the door for dramatic flair, but the cab
            roared off before it could latch, leaving him alone in the dark. A loud thunderclap
            echoed from the east. A warning to get moving.</p>
         <p>Staggering down his neighborhood street wasn’t cool but passing out on the curb was a
            sure way to spend the night on a cement bench in a jail cell. An experience he already
            lived through; twice since he'd last seen Cassie.</p>
         <p>He veered left into the alley, turned right into his yard, and leaned over the railing
            to urinate off the small wooden landing of his back entrance.</p>
         <p>“James?” Cassie’s voice came from somewhere behind him.</p>
         <p>He caught a glimpse of her over his shoulder. She stood in the shadows, her white dress
            blowing around her making her appear more like a celestial body than his best friend's
            girl. She’d held the number one spot on his avoidance list all week, since the whole
            Roxanne thing. Caleb’s name followed. Then the entire world. May as well say, fuck
            everyone.</p>
         <p>“Go home,” he said, “you’re going to get wet.”</p>
         <p>Leaving his pants undone, he unlocked the door and felt his way down the stairs, into
            the cocoon of his apartment. Soft footsteps told him Cassie followed. He kicked his
            shoes off, flicked the bathroom light on, and yanked his shirt over his head as he
            stumbled to his bed. He sprawled face forward on the mattress.</p>
         <p>The bed moved with Cassie’s slight weight. “I wanted to talk to you.”</p>
         <p>James coughed up a laugh, but the hair on his arms prickled. “If you are here to tell me
            about your romp with Cal, you're too late. Already heard everything.”</p>
         <p>Caleb told him every detail as soon as Roxanne left. How firm Cassie's breasts were, how
            tight she'd been.</p>
         <p>His gut churned the whole time, but he’d grinned and even threw in a couple of lewd
            comments. Afterward he’d excused himself to wash Roxanne's stink off and throw up on the
            shower floor. To make matters worse, Caleb only told him the details because he’d
            demanded to know. He had put himself in this crazy position.</p>
         <p>He’d made it to work that morning, then picked up a bottle of vodka and caught a
            southbound train to Traci's. The remainder of the week was spent trying to find balance
            between staying sober enough to function, but not sober enough to think.</p>
         <p>“Caleb told you?” She sounded wounded.</p>
         <p>He wanted to laugh at her niavete, except laughing seemed wrong, and suddenly he felt
            like crying.</p>
         <p>“Did he tell you everything, or just that we did it?”</p>
         <p>“I'm not talking about Cal and you fucking.” The words tasted bitter. Still on his
            belly, he fumbled his phone out of his pocket. “It’s past midnight. Why are you
            here?”</p>
         <p>“I wanted to see you.”</p>
         <p>“You’ve seen me. You can go.”</p>
         <p>“Stop it. I’m worried about you. You’ve been MIA for days.” She sniffled. “Does your
            disappearance have anything to do with me sleeping with Caleb?”</p>
         <p>“Of course not. You can do whatever you want—so can I.”</p>
         <p>He had—six times. Seven if he counted Roxanne. Useless attempts to block out the memory
            of Cassie's lips on his. He buried his face in his pillow. “Things aren’t always about
            you.”</p>
         <p>“But you kissed me. I wondered…”</p>
         <p>“And you gave me an out. Frenemies, remember. I shouldn't have kissed you. I'm sorry it
            happened.” It was the best he could offer. “Can I pass out now?”</p>
         <p>“What have you been doing all week?” she asked, making it apparent she had no intentions
            of leaving. “I have no right to ask, but I want to know.”</p>
         <p>He almost laughed. “No, you don't.”</p>
         <p>“I have no right to ask? Or I don't want to know?”</p>
         <p>“Both.”</p>
         <p>The sudden weight of her body as she straddled his waist, surprised him. Her face
            pressed against the back of his neck, raising the fine hair that ran down his spine. “Do
            you always have to smell so good?”</p>
         <p>His stomach butterflied and it wasn’t from the booze. “Stop it. I'm too drunk to take
            advantage of whatever is going through your head.”</p>
         <p>“You realize you said that out loud?” </p>
         <p>He did. But he’d kept his second thought private—the desire to hold her all night. That
            idea scared the hell out of him.</p>
         <p>“Go home,” he said to the wall. It would respond the same. “Cut me some slack.
            Please.”</p>
         <p>“Saying please is so unlike you, James.”</p>
         <p>She traced circles between his shoulder blades. Her feathered touch stole his oxygen and
            his entire body heated from the warmth of her inner thighs. He tensed, muscles
            hardening. Couldn't she tell how her proximity killed him?</p>
         <p>She stopped sketching. “Where were you drinking tonight?”</p>
         <p>“Alexa's.” It wasn’t a lie; he’d seen her once.</p>
         <p>“Have you been drunk all week?” The slight change in her voice mimicked Caleb's when he
            tried to conceal his concern.</p>
         <p>“Sober for work,” he said. If he gave her the answers she wanted, maybe she’d
            disappear.</p>
         <p>“Work? Where do you work?”</p>
         <p>He hadn't meant to say that, but the blood had drained from his brain. To his amazement,
            she let it slide. Instead, she kissed a hot pathway to the small of his back then tugged
            his pants lower so her tongue could touch the base of his spine. She sucked on his skin
            like she wanted to give him a hickey, before kissing her way back up.</p>
         <p>He flattened out, pushing his hips into three inches of memory foam.</p>
         <p>“James. Roll over. I’m trying to get your attention. We need to talk.”</p>
         <p>Jaysus, she had one hundred percent of his attention. He rose to his elbows and she
            shifted her weight, allowing him to flip over. She settled on his groin, his jeans
            halfway down his hips. Thanks to her fashion choice, only two layers of cotton underwear
            separated her from him.</p>
         <p>“How many times?” He chewed on his bottom lip, barely able to contain the urge to buck
            his hips upward and sink into her softness.</p>
         <p>“How many times what?”</p>
         <p>He covered his eyes with his arm. “How many times have you been with Cal?”</p>
         <p>“Once. Only once. I haven't even seen him for a couple of days. I think he's been
            searching for you.”</p>
         <p>He removed his arm. “Did you like it?”</p>
         <p>The space between her eyebrows narrowed. “You can have any girl you want.”</p>
         <p>“Answer the question, Cassie”</p>
         <p>She gazed down at him like he was transparent. “You admitted you sleep with whomever,
            just because you can.”</p>
         <p>Water pelted the windows, the beginning of the storm. A thunderclap made her jerk. He
            laced his fingers through hers. “What if I said I wanted you right now?”</p>
         <p>“You don’t. Not like Caleb does. You want to use me.”</p>
         <p>Grinning, he tugged her closer, even though his words would push her away. “Yeah,
            angel,” he said, “I'll use you tonight and tomorrow. Maybe for a couple of years.”</p>
         <p>He kept smiling but closed his eyes.</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>“What does that mean?” Why did he always say the exact opposite of what she could read
            on his face? “You just admitted you're using me?”</p>
         <p>Nothing about her encounters with James made concrete sense, but right now, the way he
            looked at her was solid and very real.</p>
         <p>His smile faded. “You didn't answer me. Did you like being with Cal?”</p>
         <p>She buried her head into the crook of his neck and slipped her words into his ear. “I
            have nothing to compare it to.”</p>
         <p>His breathing hitched. “Do you want something to compare it to?”</p>
         <p>She nodded. Her forehead brushed the rough patch on his chin and her heart exploded into
            an insistent mantra, sex would be better with James. A single glance from him dissolved
            her into a puddle and holding his hand felt like an intimate gesture. She wanted him
            inside her. It was the only way she’d get enough of him.</p>
         <p>One time. That’s it. Then she would know what being with him was like. If she ever
            planned to get James out of her system, she needed to do this. He didn’t move so she
            jiggled against him. Guilt should have swallowed her whole, but nothing outside of
            James’ room mattered.</p>
         <p>Molten warmth seeped through her as he slid his hands under her dress, then snaked them
            against the bare skin of her waist. They may as well be in her panties—the reaction
            would be the same. She sat upright to breathe.</p>
         <p>“Where are you going, angel?” His throaty tone teased her ears.</p>
         <p>“Nowhere. I just want to look at you.”</p>
         <p>“See me then.” He blinked up at her, his eyes dark. “Tar anseo.”</p>
         <p>The words were foreign, but it didn’t matter. He pulled her down and their lips
            collided. His tongue filled her mouth. She wanted to experience every inch of him, in
            ways that embarrassed her just thinking about them. He broke away, panting.</p>
         <p>“Take your dress off.” He grabbed the hem and removed it for her, then unhooked her bra
            and pulled it off her shoulders.</p>
         <p>She scooted downward, to his thighs. His unblinking expression and the rapid rise and
            fall of his chest were as hot as what lay, still concealed under the cotton of his
            briefs. She drifted her fingers back and forth across the bare skin above the waistband
            of his underwear. The word unity fully visible.</p>
         <p>“When did this happen?” She trailed her finger down the obvious lump underneath the
            cotton.</p>
         <p>“Around the time you started kissing my back.”</p>
         <p>His honest answer cracked her heart open. Wanting him bare, she tugged his jeans to
            indicate her intentions. </p>
         <p>He frowned but wiggled his hips and shimmied out of his pants.</p>
         <p>“You do remember you are topless?” he pointed out. “Not that I'm not enjoying the
            show—but you're so engrossed in me, I think you might have forgotten.”</p>
         <p>“I am engrossed in you.”</p>
         <p>Hungry was the more appropriate word. She slipped her finger under the waistband of his
            boxer briefs.</p>
         <p>His hand, caressing her waist, stilled.</p>
         <p>She met his gaze.</p>
         <p>“I feel like an experiment,” he said, after a second.</p>
         <p>“You sort of are. Is that okay?”</p>
         <p>“It's kind of hot in a weird way. Most girls never ask me what I want.”</p>
         <p>Cassie nodded, her hand still on his belly, waiting for permission. “I want to see you.
            Is that okay?” Words that should have embarrassed her, didn’t.</p>
         <p>“Angel, I'm too wrecked to do much—which is a good thing.” He narrowed his eyes. “I’ve
            never let anyone do this before—have their way with me, and you are the last person I
            should.” He sighed. “I’m going to bloody hell.”</p>
         <p>Until now, she hadn’t believed his claims of not letting girls touch him. With her eyes
            locked on his, she dipped her fingers beneath his waistband, teasing the skin of his
            abdomen. Her knuckles brushed his erection.</p>
         <p>His eyes widened.</p>
         <p>“Are you okay?” She paused again.</p>
         <p>He nodded, but his face was unreadable.</p>
         <p>Smiling, she plucked at the material. “Really, James. Plain white. Do you always buy
            such boring undergarments?”</p>
         <p>“I don't buy my kacks.”</p>
         <p>“Hmm. Who does your shopping?”</p>
         <p>He shrugged.</p>
         <p>“Well, I’m going to buy you some with polka dots or hearts on them.”</p>
         <p>“Take them off if they bother you that much.” His tone was smooth. </p>
         <p>With shaking hands, she uncovered the rest of the tattoo. A skull with a cross on its
            forehead, its skeletal forearms crossed underneath. It held guns in its bony grip.</p>
         <p>A couple of inches from the skull, the scar from the knife had healed into a thin red
            line. Beside it was another tattoo, a handle of what appeared to be a sword. The
            letters, Niʹ Bhr printed on the blade, ran downward, over his hip bone.</p>
         <p>“Keep going,” he whispered as she tugged his briefs to his thighs to expose every
            vulnerable inch of him.</p>
         <p>He sucked in a deep breath. The motion resonated through her body and again she met his
            gaze, amazed he allowed this.</p>
         <p>“What?” He propped himself up on his elbows. “Speak, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>“You're—” What were the right words?</p>
         <p>“Large. Yeah, I know.”</p>
         <p>“I was going to say hairless.”</p>
         <p>A deep blush covered his face, apparent even in the half-lit room. “I know that
            too.”</p>
         <p>“Why?”</p>
         <p>“It shows off the artwork better.”</p>
         <p>“What's the point if nobody sees it?”</p>
         <p>“You're seeing it.”</p>
         <p>Her eyes flicked back to his tattoos. The rest of the quote read, Niʹ Bhrisfear Meʹ. It
            was written lengthwise down the blade of a short sword. She ran the tip of her finger
            along the letters. They were raised, like they were on a ridge, but between the dim
            light and the ink, she couldn’t see why. “What does the verse say.”</p>
         <p>“Loosely, it means I won’t be broken.” He lay back, his arm over his face, and inhaled a
            breath deep enough to lift his rib cage. “That’s enough.”</p>
         <p>“Do you want me to be done?” She frowned.</p>
         <p>His chest rose again. “You look with your eyes, not your hands.”</p>
         <p>“So, you don't want me to do this?” She wrapped her fingers around the velvet skin of
            his penis. Surprised by its firmness she rubbed her thumb along its length. Something
            inside her tightened.</p>
         <p>He blew out a puff of air but it didn’t stop her.</p>
         <p>She swallowed. “Does your skull tattoo mean anything?”</p>
         <p>“It means a lot, but if you want an art lesson, you’ll have to stop squeezing my cock.
            You’re driving me mad.”</p>
         <p>She released him and leaned forward enough to uncover his eyes. “I like that I can do
            that to you.”</p>
         <p>“You have no idea what you do to me.”</p>
         <p>She had some idea; the physical aspects were obvious. But did he trust her? How far
            would he let her go? What did he smell like? What did he taste like? She would never
            have this opportunity again.</p>
         <p>More relaxed than when she was with Caleb, she hovered her lips just under his belly
            button, her cheek against his erection and inhaled the faint scent of soap. On a whim,
            she ran her tongue up the underside of his penis.</p>
         <p>He jumped. “Holy fuck.”</p>
         <p>“Sorry.” She sat up.</p>
         <p>“Don't be sorry. I’ve never...” He shimmied upward, propping himself against the
            headboard. “It's hard to lay still and let you examine me.”</p>
         <p>“I want to understand how guys work.” How you work, she wanted to say. She wanted to
            learn everything about him. “Caleb was the first guy I ever touched… Sorry.” This wasn’t
            the time to bring up another guy’s name, especially that one.</p>
         <p>His fingers graced the contour of her neck. “It's okay. Talk. This whole night’s
            bizarre.”</p>
         <p>“It happened so fast with Caleb, and we were under a sheet so it's not like I saw
            anything.”</p>
         <p>“We really are each other’s experiment?” He paused. “Nothing more, nothing less?”</p>
         <p>She nodded, ignoring her heart’s silent pull for more. “You’re all sticky.”</p>
         <p>“My body wants to fuck you.” He kicked his briefs the rest of the way off.</p>
         <p>“But you don’t?”</p>
         <p>He sighed. “Even doused in alcohol, my brain is screaming, it’s a very, very, bad
            idea.”</p>
         <p>James' morality meter dinging before hers set off a tiny alarm in the back of her head.
            Even so, she slipped her thumb over the tip of his penis, then placed her lips where her
            thumb had been, gently kissing the top. How could something be so hard, feel so soft?
            How could someone be so crazy, be so sweet?</p>
         <p>James remained silent, letting her do what she wanted, but his fingers knotted the
            blankets. She placed her hands over his and squeezed.</p>
         <p>“Come up here, angel. I want to kiss you.” His voice was thick.</p>
         <p>His body, long and lean, twitched under her lips as she kissed her way upward, until his
            lips were under hers and his heart thundered against her ribs. A heated tangle of limbs
            and tongues, skin on skin.</p>
         <p>Deep kisses drove her to the edge of a cliff and left her hanging. Pressed flat against
            him wasn't close enough. She wrapped her legs around his hips. Still not close enough.
            She maneuvered her position until his hardness rubbed against the crotch of her panties.
            Not close enough.</p>
         <p>James moaned and rolled to his side, taking her with him. “Cassie, I’m not kidding. I
            don't want to sleep with you. What we're doing is bad enough.” He closed his eyes, his
            breaths fast. “I'm too drunk, anyway.”</p>
         <p>The words punctured her heart. “I happen to know you prefer to be drunk when you have
            sex.” Only something inside her shifted. It wasn't about sex anymore. It was about him.
            Experiencing all of him. But he didn't want her, and it hurt.</p>
         <p>He kissed her hand. “I can't think straight right now. All this touching is freaking me
            out. Everything is freaking me out.” He inched closer and rested his cheek on her
            curtain of hair, fanned across the pillow. “Can we just fall asleep beside each
            other?”</p>
         <p>“Okay.” She nodded, but disappointment registered in her voice. She blinked back tears.
            He didn’t desire her. Even naked on top of him, he hadn’t touched her. Not really. Not
            where she expected he would.</p>
         <p>James flipped around to his favored stomach position. “Did it work?”</p>
         <p>“Huh?”</p>
         <p>“What you said in the hospital. Do you want Cal more now that you have slept with him?
            Do you feel more secure?”</p>
         <p>“Yeah,” she wavered, “sure.”</p>
         <p>James sighed. “I told you it didn't work that way.”</p>

         <h4>Chapter 31</h4>
         <p>Cassie stopped at home to shower and changed into a swimsuit and cut off shorts. Nobody
            was there to notice her night’s absence. No surprise. Shaking off the sinking feeling of
            abandonment, she looked out her window. Caleb was in his pool. Her disappearance hadn’t
            altered his swim routine either.</p>
         <p>Caleb was in the shallow end as she trudged across his yard. He gave her a quick wave
            then tugged red goggles over his eyes before diving under. She dangled her feet in the
            cool blue water and waited. When he surfaced, he held a green diving ring that he
            pitched to the side.</p>
         <p>“Sorry. I haven’t had much time for you this week,” he said as he pulled himself out to
            sit beside her. He pushed the goggles to his forehead and smiled, broad and unassuming.
            “I called last night.”</p>
         <p>“I went to bed early.” The lie hurt her stomach, but she managed an even tone and met
            his gaze. Tufts of hair stuck out around the band of the goggles; his eyes, as clear as
            the sky behind him. He was cute, dependable, and hers. Everything she needed.</p>
         <p>He raised an eyebrow, but his smile seemed sincere. “Are you okay with… everything? We
            can go back to holding hands.”</p>
         <p>“I don't want to go backward.” She laced her fingers with his. Her boyfriend. The guy
            who wanted her.</p>
         <p>Tension melted from his shoulders. “When you didn't answer last night, I thought you
            were mad at me for not calling.”</p>
         <p>“I’m not mad.” Cute and dependable was better than crazy and confused, even if Crazy was
            so hot, he burnt like wildfire, consuming everything in sight.</p>
         <p>Besides, Crazy didn’t want her.</p>
         <p>She squeezed Cute and Dependable’s hand. “You look happy.”</p>
         <p>“Just feeling lucky.” He laid back, his legs still in the pool, and closed his eyes.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Caleb’s gate banged shut. Cassie exhaled when Ron emerged from the corner of the garage,
            though her relief it wasn’t James was bound to be short lived. She’d have to see him
            sometime.</p>
         <p>Ron eyed her as he passed, his slight grin akin to a used car salesman. He dumped the
            contents of his pockets onto a metal side table and kicked off his slides. Beads of
            sweat glistened on his shirtless chest.</p>
         <p>His gaze slid to Caleb. “Where’s James?”</p>
         <p>Caleb released her hand. “Why does everyone assume I always know where he is?”</p>
         <p>Chuckling, Ron eased himself into the shallow end. Arms wrapped around his torso, he
            faced her. “How ‘bout you, Cassie? Do you know where he is?”</p>
         <p>The question punched her like a bolt of electricity. Ron’s grin widened.</p>
         <p>“You get into the water like a girl, Ronald,” Caleb said before she could answer.
            Defense she didn’t deserve. “Go swim in your own pool.”</p>
         <p>Still grinning, Ron flipped Caleb off. “My dad got mad at the pool guy. Our backyard now
            resembles a science experiment.” He climbed out as carefully as he got in, then
            stretched across a chaise. He waved his phone in the air. “You need to check this out,
            dude.”</p>
         <p>Sitting had become painful. She stepped out of her shorts then slid into the deep
            end.</p>
         <p>After four lengths of freestyle, the gate slammed shut again. Between strokes, she
            caught a glimpse of ratty Converse, and ankles covered in now-familiar ink. She
            concentrated on her stroke, but something interfered with the correct execution of her
            flip turn. Her feet touched bottom. She straightened, sputtering.</p>
         <p>“Hi, Cassie.” The corner of James’ undone shirt dipped into the pool as he leaned beside
            her to test the water. The scent of soap lingered on his chest. The word Unity popped
            into her brain.</p>
         <p>She adjusted her bikini straps and willed herself not to look at his abdomen. His
            arrival had caught Ron’s attention, but Caleb didn’t give him so much as a glance.</p>
         <p>“I think you're being ignored,” she said.</p>
         <p>James waved his hand in front of her face. “By Cal—or by you?”</p>
         <p>He leaned closer, to push away one of the floating lights. “Cal’s pissed at me for my
            recent disappearing act. What’s funny is he couldn’t find me, but you did. How long have
            you been here, anyway?”</p>
         <p>“A bit. Why?”</p>
         <p>“No reason.” He dropped his shirt onto the deck and strode to the deep end.</p>
         <p>Cassie leaned back, against the ledge, heartbeat in her ears as he ascended the diving
            board. He raised both brows at her before he dove.</p>
         <p>She moved over and resumed her laps. But her concentration was blown.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Although he’d been awake when Cassie left, James took his time going to Caleb’s. He
            needed a spacer between his night with Cassie and talking to Caleb. Time to get his head
            around what he allowed to happen—and move on.</p>
         <p>Because he had to.</p>
         <p>He stripped his bed, then showered. After that, he practiced guitar riffs until his
            fingers were numb, and dreaming up chord variations were the single thought in his
            head.</p>
         <p>At that point, and only at that point, did he feel controlled enough to see Cal.</p>
         <p>Of course, she was there.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Unable to avoid things any longer, James climbed out of the pool and crossed the pavers.
            He plopped onto one of the chairs and waited.</p>
         <p>“Wow, Ronnie.” Caleb jutted his chin in James’ direction. “Look who’s decided to grace
            us with his presence.”</p>
         <p>“Where have you been?” Ron asked before James could utter a word.</p>
         <p>“Great.” James huffed. “You have Ronnie on my tail, now?” Five minutes in the yard and
            he wanted to punch the guy.</p>
         <p>“Relax, asshole.” Ron leaned back; ankles crossed. “I don't give a shit what happens to
            you. But I need a favor.”</p>
         <p>“A favor?”</p>
         <p>“I want you to set me up with that girl.”</p>
         <p>James spat out a laugh. “You’re slagging me, right? What girl?”</p>
         <p>Cassie climbed out of the pool. She adjusted her bottoms and padded across the pavers to
            lean over the back of Cal’s chair, her breasts spilling out the top of her bikini.</p>
         <p>Breasts he’d refused to taste, even though they had been in his face; the left one a
            little bigger, the right one freckled. He studied the front legs of Caleb’s chair,
            loosely aware of Caleb pulling Cassie onto his knee.</p>
         <p>“Hey.” Caleb snapped his fingers in front of James’ face. “He’s talking about the girls
            from the beach. The ones we played volleyball with… Remember? One was all over you?”
            Cal’s voice hitched the way it did when he lied.</p>
         <p>James remembered, but gave Cal a blank stare, letting him stew. He hadn’t liked the
            redhead, whatever her name was, and couldn’t get a visual on her friend.</p>
         <p>Caleb chuckled, but his cheeks were pink and his forehead glossy. “Ronnie bumped into
            them again, last night. Somehow, they started talking about us. The one Ron likes, wants
            you. Go figure.”</p>
         <p>“Fuck you. I’m the one with the birthday invite. Tonight, at her lake house.” Ron held
            out his phone, but James refused it. She insisted I bring you, and you’re clearly not
            interested. So I figure come, be your usual I-don’t-give-a-shit, pretentious self.
            She’ll be heartbroken and I’ll come to her rescue.”</p>
         <p>Caleb examined him. “You’re not interested, right?”</p>
         <p>“What did she look like?” James tried harder to conjure an image of her, but the water
            dripping from Cassie’s hair had pooled between her breasts.</p>
         <p>“She’s blonde, James.” Ron sounded exasperated. “Her name is Mary. Hello. Does any of
            this ring a bell?”</p>
         <p>It didn’t. The evening was a blur, other than Caleb slept with the redhead. That part
            was hard to forget. He shrugged. “I’d just got out of rehab, Cal.”</p>
         <p>“You have serious memory issues.” Ron tapped his own head with his forefinger. “You
            might want to go get a CAT scan or something.”</p>
         <p>Not giving a damn what Ron thought, James shrugged at Caleb again.</p>
         <p> “Give it a rest.” Caleb glared at Ron. “If he doesn’t remember, he doesn’t remember.
            All the better for you.”</p>
         <p>James closed his eyes. Once things were smoothed over, he would do what Caleb said. A
            strategy that worked for years.</p>
         <p>“How’s your memory, Cal?” Ron asked. “I’m sure you remember one redhead in
            particular?”</p>
         <p>James jerked to attention. Caleb’s tanned complexion turned white.</p>
         <p>Cassie grimaced, but she seemed more disgusted than angry. “This whole conversation is
            ridiculous.” She sighed, but she was ruffled, it was easy to see. “Caleb can talk to
            other girls. Stop being such a jerk, Ron.”</p>
         <p>“Ooh.” Appearing withered, Ron placed his hand on his heart. “When you stop being a
            naïve little bitch, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>James sprang to his feet. He booted the leg of Ron’s chair. “Get up, asshole.”</p>
         <p>Every inch of him hummed to drive his fists into Ron and make him pay for his words. Why
            the hell was Cal still sitting there?</p>
         <p>“James! Suigh siʹos.” Caleb removed Cassie from his knee and stood between them. </p>
         <p>“Shit, Caleb.” Still in his chair, Ron sputtered out a laugh. “Call off your puppy.”</p>
         <p>“You must want an ass kicking.” Caleb said, his fingers dug firmly into James’
            shoulders. “Shut up.”</p>
         <p>James strained against Caleb’s grip. “You’re going to let this piece of shite insult
            your girlfriend like that?”</p>
         <p>Cassie stood off to the side—tiny, wet, and wide eyed. He hadn’t meant to terrify
            her.</p>
         <p>“James. I’ve got this.” Caleb tried to chase down his gaze. “Ronnie, apologize. Don't
            call my girlfriend names.”</p>
         <p>“Sorry, Cassie.” Ron raised a brow. “I didn’t realize James had taken such an active
            interest in you.”</p>
         <p>“Bhfuil tu’ chomh marbh!” James lunged forward.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s full weight pushed back. “You’ll have to go through me, if you plan on killing
            him.”</p>
         <p>He’d never go through Cal. Ever.</p>
         <p>“Breathe,” Caleb said. “Tell me when I can step down.”</p>
         <p>A moment passed, the silence heavy, until James swung his gaze to Caleb. “I’m good. Let
            go of me. Jaysus.”</p>
         <p>Ears burning, he stomped toward the pool house. Cassie may not be his responsibility,
            but he planned to shut Caleb's affair with Red down, before it blindsided her.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie let out a sigh. Never in her life had she seen anyone go from relaxed to
            homicidal in under ten seconds, in her defense. It would have been nice to have James by
            her side when she lived in Kansas. Paul would have crapped his pants.</p>
         <p>Caleb pulled her onto his lap, but the seat wasn’t as cozy after Ron’s redhead
            comments.</p>
         <p>“What the shit? I didn't think I said anything he’d react like that to. I was teasing.”
            Still pale, Ron leaned back. “You don't find it a little… odd that—”</p>
         <p>She winced, but Caleb groaned. “I know what you’re going to say. Cassie spent time in
            the hospital with James. They became friends. End of story.”</p>
         <p>Ron’s eyes slid over her, assessing. He hmphed. “There goes my chance of getting any
            favors out of him.”</p>
         <p>“Well, that would serve you right.” Caleb wrapped his arms about her. “Give him some
            time. He’s not that mad or you’d be in a world of pain right now. And there’d have been
            nothing I could have done about it.”</p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 32</h4>
         <p>James sulked for twenty minutes, then emerged from the pool house. He breezed past the
            chaise where Cassie lay, sunning. She jolted upright and smiled, but he ignored her. He
            gave Caleb a curt nod before he disappeared around the garage. The gate’s thud signaled
            his departure.</p>
         <p>“Shit.” Caleb knotted his brows. “He’s still mad. Good thing Ronnie left.”</p>
         <p>She lay back down. “Wouldn’t want Ronnie to get hurt.”</p>
         <p>Caleb tossed his phone onto the chaise cushion and headed to the diving board. “Don’t
            let Ron bother you. I ignore most of what comes out of his mouth, and so should you. He
            likes to start trouble.”</p>
         <p>She’d figured that much out on her own. Still, one of Ron’s insinuations held a degree
            of truth. What if they both did?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>*</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After supper, Cassie stood at the sink in Caleb’s kitchen. With only the three of them,
            Caleb, his mom and her, there weren’t a lot of dishes, but helping to wash them was the
            least she could do.</p>
         <p>The screen door creaked open and an overpowering woodsy scent filled the room as James
            shuffled over, to lean against the center island.</p>
         <p>“You just missed supper, sweetheart,” Elizabeth said, her tone casually pleasant, and
            reserved for James. “I can make you a plate.”</p>
         <p>Cassie tried to hand the wet bean salad bowl to Caleb, but continuing to wash dishes was
            pointless. She set the bowl on the counter and turned to see what had Caleb so rapt.
            James swung the Charger’s keys lazily around his finger, lips curved into an evil
            smile.</p>
         <p>“Mom asked if you were hungry,” Caleb said. “Maybe you should consume something
            solid.”</p>
         <p>“No thanks, Mom.” James gaze skimmed Cassie. “I caught some lunch at the Y.”</p>
         <p>Caleb looked at her also.</p>
         <p>Having never eaten at the ‘Y,’ she shrugged.</p>
         <p>“Is that a new restaurant?” Elizabeth picked up the tea towel and shooed Caleb out of
            the way. “I bet my cooking is just as good.”</p>
         <p>Grinning, James tossed Caleb the keys. “Text Ronnie. I’ll go to that party, but you and
            I need to chat.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Charger’s windows vibrated with the boom of the heavy bass, the music loud enough to
            make talking impossible. Not a bad thing since Caleb and James' talk consisted of ten
            minutes of heated words by the driver’s door. A conversation not meant for her ears,
            spoken entirely in Irish.</p>
         <p>She pulled out her phone. According to the GPS, she had fifty-five minutes to endure
            James seated behind her, breathing down her neck. That was as unsettling as where she
            was headed. Who was this redheaded girl?</p>
         <p>They passed a Welcome to Ottawa, Illinois sign. Caleb stopped at a Marathon gas bar.
            Needing a break from the tension in the car, she got out to stretch her legs.</p>
         <p>Caleb appeared with two Styrofoam cups.</p>
         <p>“Drink this, it’s coffee. And don’t dump anything into it.” He passed the cup through
            the open window to James; the first indication she had that he may not be sober.</p>
         <p>“How much longer?” Ron asked once they were all back in the car. He leaned between the
            seats to reach for the phone.</p>
         <p>“Ten minutes.” Caleb pushed him back.</p>
         <p>James snickered. “Are we there yet? Are we there yet?” He lit a smoke.</p>
         <p>“Shut up, dude.” Ron coughed into his hand. “I’m going to get cancer sitting back here
            with you.”</p>
         <p>“You’re not going to need lungs if you don’t back off me,” James said, but he flipped
            his cigarette through the window, to the ground outside.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To her surprise, Illinois’s flatness became wooded and the road hilly. The odd house
            dotted the right side, boulders and thick forest lined the left. The trees and rocks
            gave way to sandy beach, and a lake bigger than Cassie expected.</p>
         <p>More houses appeared, further back on the embankment, and a line of parked cars formed
            along the soft shoulder. Caleb rounded a tight curve.</p>
         <p>“Frig this,” he said as they passed a vehicle with a smashed side mirror. “I’m not
            parking on the road.”</p>
         <p>They reached a post decorated with at least a dozen pink balloons. Caleb stopped to let
            a laughing group of bikini clad group of girls cross as they headed toward the beach,
            then he made a sharp right into a sandy driveway. He pulled onto the grassy field and
            squeezed between the last parked car and a massive, metal bin. A parking feat she would
            never have attempted.</p>
         <p>As always, people gawked at the orange Charger, then landed on them as they filed
            out.</p>
         <p>Cassie paused behind the open door. This wasn’t a high school party. She’d wanted out of
            the car, but now she wished she was still in it. Caleb approached her. In his polo and
            Bermuda shorts, he fit in with the preppy crowd.</p>
         <p>James prowled a few feet ahead, a lit cigarette already in his fingers. His rock tee
            rose above his waistband as he cracked his back and stretched. He didn’t fit in
            anywhere, and as a result, fit in everywhere.</p>
         <p>Cassie fidgeted. She and Ron resembled high schoolers trying to play adult.</p>
         <p>The property rose in a lazy slope before leveling off. A pale blue Victorian cottage sat
            at the top of the knoll surrounded by umbrellaed tables and a sea of white chairs.
            Overhead lighting brightened the early evening sky, and flames flickered from two
            firepits. At least a hundred people milled about.</p>
         <p>“I’m out,” Ron said, eying the beach where a rowdy game of volleyball was underway.
            “Come get me when you’ve devastated Mary.”</p>
         <p>Caught up in the Gatsby scene, Cassie forgot why they came. Her pulse kicked up. Not
            wanting to be blindsided, she scanned the crowd for a redheaded woman as Caleb led her
            across the grass. They stopped in front of a live band performing sound checks. All of
            them wore cowboy hats, one tuned a banjo.</p>
         <p>“Country?” she said in disbelief. Most of Blue Valley high listened to KAIR-FM, the
            local country station. It was her least favorite genre, and the cowboy hats and boots
            seemed out of place in such posh surroundings.</p>
         <p>James exhaled a puff of smoke. “Relax, Cassandra. We won’t be here long enough for you
            to hate on the band.” Coughing abruptly, he shouldered Caleb. “Red. Marbh romhainn.”</p>
         <p>A slim girl wearing an oversized tangerine kimono—a shade lighter than her
            hair—approached them.</p>
         <p>“Hey, Amber.” Pink-cheeked, Caleb shook Amber's outstretched hand. “Thanks for the
            invite. This is my girlfriend, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>“Welcome.” Amber smiled a bit too wide. She lowered her eyes to Cassie's feet before
            traveling upward. “Where do you go to school?”</p>
         <p>“University of Chicago, Lab School.” Cassie met the girl’s stare as she rattled off the
            full name of the school she would be attending in the fall.</p>
         <p>Confusion flitted across Amber’s features. “Isn’t that a high school?”</p>
         <p>“Didn’t you take some time off to travel?” James said, from Caleb’s left.</p>
         <p>“James.” Amber’s attention drifted to him. “You left us the other day before Mary got to
            invite you to her party. Isn’t it great we met up with your friend?”</p>
         <p>“Brilliant.” James gave her his fuck-off smile, a look Cassie had long been on the
            receiving end. “I’m gonna go check things out. Insint di, Cal.”</p>
         <p>Amber tracked James' exit. When she looked back, she was no longer smiling. “What did he
            say?”</p>
         <p>“That he’s excited to see Mary.” Caleb chuckled, a sound at odds with his expression. He
            slid his fingers back through Cassie’s. “Catch you later, Amber.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>“Who are these people?” Cassie asked when Caleb finally stopped, in front of the
            farthest firepit.</p>
         <p>“College friends of Amber’s and Mary’s, I guess.”</p>
         <p>“Amber’s a complete snob. She can’t have that many friends.”</p>
         <p>Caleb snorted. “I barely know her.”</p>
         <p>“How is it that you're friends?” She searched his face, but did she really want to know?
            She’d been so distant the week James was in rehab; she couldn’t blame Caleb if he messed
            around. Right when he needed her most, she bailed.</p>
         <p>“You heard the story.” Caleb’s tone remained even, “I met her on the beach, a while
            back.”</p>
         <p>“The day you picked James up from Rockford?”</p>
         <p>“That's the day.” He met her gaze. “What’s with the questioning? I like you. If I wanted
            to fool around, I wouldn't have brought you with me, right?”</p>
         <p>It was logical, but not comforting.</p>
         <p>“Besides, I’m here for a buddy.”</p>
         <p>“Ronnie?”</p>
         <p>He grimaced. “I wouldn’t haul my ass all the way out here for Ronald. I’m kind of hoping
            James goes for Mary. She’s pretty and smart. She might calm him down.”</p>
         <p>She took a steadying breath. “What do you think about what Ron insinuated? About me and
            James?”</p>
         <p>“I think Ronnie doesn’t know him very well—or you. James would never do that to me, and
            you’ve seen him at his worst. I can’t see you being interested.” He kissed her forehead.
            “Speaking of which, we should probably go find him before he… Well, before he does
            something James-ish.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>They found Ron first, on a patio chair, a full red cup in his hand. Caleb pulled two
            chairs closer. “What’s up?” he asked as he sat.</p>
         <p>“Your bro isn't following my plan.” Ron motioned to the horde of line dancing bodies in
            front of the band. James stood, feet planted on the sidelines, while a girl Cassie
            assumed was Mary danced around him.</p>
         <p>Pretty, honey blonde, and tiny, Mary exuded an air of confidence. She probably always
            got what she wanted, and what she wanted came through loud and clear. She couldn’t keep
            her eyes—or her hands—off James.</p>
         <p>Cassie hated her.</p>
         <p>“Hey,” Caleb called out when the song ended. He waved them over.</p>
         <p>“Cal, you remember Mary,” James said, “and I believe you know Ronald.” He gave Ron a
            toothy smile.</p>
         <p>Cassie peeked at Ron. His red face would have been more amusing had she not been so busy
            trying to keep her own features neutral.</p>
         <p>James’ eyes met hers, flat and unreadable. “This is Caleb's girlfriend, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>Mary nodded politely, then ran her hand up James’ arm, making it clear that even if he
            followed Ron’s plan, she’d never go for someone else. Ron’s slumped posture confirmed he
            concluded the same thing.</p>
         <p>“Let’s go play beer pong.” James grasped Mary’s rogue hand. They headed toward the game,
            a slight waver in his gait.</p>
         <p>“Don’t get too trashed,” Caleb said, as Ron gulped his drink. “I may need help with him
            tonight.”</p>
         <p>“Screw that.” Ron finished his beverage then crushed his cup. “I want to get drunk as
            fuck and puke on him in the car.”</p>
         <p>“I’m not drinking,” Cassie said. “I can watch him.”</p>
         <p>Ron chuckled.</p>
         <p>“I meant I can drive.” She issued Ron her best pinched lip glare.</p>
         <p>Caleb turned toward the pong table, oblivious to their struggle. “That's okay, Cassie,”
            he said, without looking at her, “Let’s go watch the game.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>Bouncing balls into a cup made as much sense to her as throwing caps at beer bottles,
            but a crowd had gathered around the table.</p>
         <p>“You'd think these college guys would have this figured out,” Caleb mumbled after a few
            rounds. “James would drink less if he was losing.”</p>
         <p>Caleb was right. James was lucky with his shot but drank regardless of sinking the ball
            or not. A half empty bottle of Vodka sat next to him. He bounced another ball into the
            designated cup and Mary squealed with pleasure. Doe-eyed, she rubbed his back, then
            hooked her thumb through his belt loop.</p>
         <p>“I'm going to tell him to slow down,” Caleb said after a few minutes, “then find a
            bathroom. You’ll be okay here for a while?”</p>
         <p>She nodded. She didn’t want to trail her boyfriend to the bathroom. If she couldn’t
            trust him, what was the point?</p>
         <p>Whatever Caleb said to James made him scowl, but he set his drink down. Sick of
            watching, Cassie found a chair and turned it toward the dance floor. Someone tapped her
            on the shoulder. James stood behind her, leaving Mary alone and cross-armed by the pong
            table.</p>
         <p>“Mary is staring at you.” Cassie pivoted, back to the dance floor.</p>
         <p>“Let her.” James pulled at her arm until she got to her feet. “I need to talk to
            you.”</p>
         <p>Since arguing with him when he’d been drinking was impossible, she let him lead her down
            the hill and across the road. He paused on the beach long enough to look around before
            charging forward along the shore.</p>
         <p>She dug her heels into the soft sand. “I’m not going on a hike with you.”</p>
         <p>“Come on, Cassie. To the other side of that crag.” He pointed down the beach, where a
            rugged bluff towered over the water. “Please.”</p>
         <p>She peered over her shoulder. “What if Ron sees you drag me out here?”</p>
         <p>“It’s getting dark.” He grinned. “And I don't give a shit who sees.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The sand gave way to gravel as they rounded a soft bend. A rocky formation at the base
            of the bluff spilled into the lake, the last few stones wet and slippery from waves.</p>
         <p>James felt along the side of a boulder. He stepped gingerly onto the wet rocks and
            disappeared around the other side. Nimbler, thanks to the lack of alcohol, Cassie
            followed. She smacked into James’ back. He’d stopped short, hands on his hips. The rocks
            on the far side extended well into the water, leaving him nowhere to go. They were
            tucked into a tiny alcove.</p>
         <p>She surveyed the six feet of gravelly space. “Isn’t this convenient.”</p>
         <p>He kicked one brow up. “It would be way more convenient if I were bringing a chick out
            here to dick.”</p>
         <p>She crossed her arms, then, not wanting to resemble Mary, uncrossed them. “What’s going
            on, James?” She drew out the final s. “If someone doesn’t tell me what is up, I’m going
            to lose it.”</p>
         <p>“So suspicious, Cas-san-dra.” He mimicked her extended enunciation then whipped a stone
            into the lake.</p>
         <p>“Stop it.” She clamped her fingers into fists. “What’s with all the secretive Irish
            conversations? Is there something going on between Caleb and Amber?”</p>
         <p>He stared at her a second longer than what felt comfortable, then looked at the ground.
            When he raised his head, his expression had darkened.</p>
         <p>“Oh my God.” Tears filled her eyes as she slumped against a rock, her body reacting to
            what her brain already knew. Caleb fooled around. James would never tell, but a verbal
            confirmation wasn’t needed. </p>
         <p>James stepped forward then backward, then forward again. “He’s not interested in Amber…
            not like that.” He cleared his throat and leaned closer. “He likes you. Don’t cry.”</p>
         <p>He paused, his mouth near her jaw, then his lips pressed down on hers—hard. He backed
            her against the rocks and pushed into her, his breathing heavy. The weight of his hips,
            flat against hers, shut her brain down. With her arms around his neck, she pulled him
            tight and opened her mouth wide, allowing his tongue to turn her insides to liquid.</p>
         <p>“Fuck.” As fast as he approached her, he broke away. Jamming his hands into his pockets,
            he stared at her like she was every bit the Siren he accused her of being all those
            weeks ago.</p>
         <p>She hoisted herself up, to sit on a rock. Now eye level, she caught a shadow of herself,
            trapped in his dilated pupils.</p>
         <p>She hadn’t meant to react like that. But like an exhilarating amusement ride, James
            always seemed to knock her on her ass, senses spinning. But thats all it was. A
            momentary lapse of judgment based on hormones. Stupid, senseless, and haunting.</p>
         <p>“Why did you bring me out here?” It hurt to pull the words out of her scrambled
            thoughts.</p>
         <p>“Not to fucking do this.”</p>
         <p>He paced the few feet to the water’s edge, his back heaving under the thin material of
            his shirt and stared upward to the newly appearing stars. “I wish Cal would stop putting
            me in this position.”</p>
         <p>“What position?”</p>
         <p>He faced her. “Alone with you.”</p>
         <p>“What does Caleb have to do with this?” She bristled. “What did you say to him, in
            Irish? When Amber was there?” He would be honest.</p>
         <p>James looked away. “I told Cal to ditch her.”</p>
         <p>“And your job is to keep me entertained while they talk?”</p>
         <p>His cheeks reddened. “It’s not like that.” He stalked toward her reached for her knee,
            but she knocked his hand away.</p>
         <p>“Did he tell you to kiss me too?”</p>
         <p>“Jaysus, Cassie. No.” He clasped his hands behind his head. “Stop breaking my balls with
            questions when I’m too drunk to think straight.”</p>
         <p>“Stop drinking! Maybe then, you’d stop messing things up.” Somebody needed to say it.
            She took a steadying breath. “Why didn’t you follow Ron’s plans tonight?”</p>
         <p>He slid his hands back into his pockets. His top lip curled into the sneer that had been
            absent from their last few interactions. “Maybe my plan was to fuck her brains out.”</p>
         <p>“Move.” She scrambled off the rock and shoved him backward. “I want to see Caleb, and
            you can go screw the crap out of Mary. See if I care.”</p>
         <p>But her tone deceived her. She cared and could tell by the tightening of his jaw he
            heard it too. Pushing past him, she scrambled over the wet rocks onto the beach.</p>
         <p>“Damn it, Cassie.” He caught up to her, his pant legs wet to his knees. “It’s none of
            your business who I’m fucking. You think one night in my bed makes you mean something to
            me? You’re wrong. You have a serious possessive streak I don’t think Caleb even knows
            about.”</p>
         <p>His phone went off and he scanned his messages. “Amber’s no longer a problem. Your
            relationship is fucking secure. Happy?”</p>
         <p>She stepped around him, but he grabbed her wrist. “Let it go. You both made mistakes,
            only he’ll never know about yours. And that’s a good thing.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>Caleb leaned against the front panel of his car, Amber nowhere in sight.</p>
         <p>“James texted me that he took you for a walk down the beach.” He frowned at James’ wet
            pant legs. “Did you have fun?”</p>
         <p>“It was a feckin blast, Cal,” James answered for her. “Where’s Ronnie?”</p>
         <p>Caleb jerked a thumb toward the back of the car. “Passed out in the back seat.”</p>
         <p>He pulled Cassie in for a long, unexpected kiss. She kissed back, but her head was
            scrambled, her heart numb.</p>
         <p>The car horn blared. James glared at them through the windshield. Unlocking herself from
            Caleb, she slid past the steering wheel to the middle.</p>
         <p>Caleb started the car. Once they backed out, he laid his arm over her shoulders. On her
            other side, James moved closer to the door. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 33</h4>
         <p>From outside the pool house window, Cassie had a clear view of James and Caleb as they
            relaxed at the bistro table, cards in hand. If James hung around to drive her crazy, it
            worked. He hadn’t spoken to her all day, not that he had to. What he’d said at the lake
            was enough. </p>
         <p>She pulled out her phone and thumbed, Put the cards down. I’m outside.</p>
         <p>Inside, Caleb checked his messages. His eyes flicked to the window. He said something to
            James, then tossed his cards onto the table.</p>
         <p>The door slammed and Caleb appeared around the corner. “What are you doing out
            here?”</p>
         <p>Wanting to make sure James hadn’t followed, she peeked through the side of the window.
            James was in his chair but turned toward the glass. Thanks to the dark sky he probably
            saw his own reflection, but she jumped back. “Can we do something without him? I’m tired
            of being a threesome.”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s brows shot up, indicating her word choice sucked.</p>
         <p>“Sure,” he said, one brow still raised. “He knows you’re out here, by the way.”</p>
         <p>The statement dangled between them. She checked the house again. The room was empty.</p>
         <p>“He’s not in his chair.” She braced herself for James impromptu appearance.</p>
         <p>“Jesus, Cassie. He’s probably in the can.” Caleb shook his head. “He’s got plans in an
            hour. Come by then.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p> ***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Caleb’s idea of doing something became a retro movie. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes had
            been awful, not that the title got her hopes up. Caleb did all the right boyfriend
            things—held her hand and bought her popcorn—but every so often, she caught him watching
            her, forehead furrowed.</p>
         <p>“Do you mind if I make a quick stop?” he asked as they sat in the idling Charger. It was
            the only thing he’d said since they’d left the theater.</p>
         <p>“Sure,” she said, though she’d rather go back to the pool house. The first drops of rain
            splattered the windshield making it a good night to spend together, under a blanket,
            listening to thunder.</p>
         <p>“Ten minutes.” He crossed his heart. “I promise.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A barrage of convoluted alley shortcuts dumped them into a dense fog. They rolled to a
            stop on a barely lit street lined with abandoned warehouses.</p>
         <p>Caleb parallel parked behind Allison’s purple Volkswagen bug, a surprise as it didn’t
            seem like a place anyone would want to be, let alone Allison.</p>
         <p>“It smells like wet metal,” she said as she followed Caleb alongside the front of a tall
            brick building, its bottom windows painted black. They had to be near water, but she
            didn’t recall looping east.</p>
         <p>“It’s all the factories.” Caleb stopped in front of a large, metal door. “James claims
            it smells like old money, but it reminds me of urban decay.” Using both hands, he slid
            the door sideways. The castors squeaked and the door thudded against its stop.</p>
         <p>The room they stepped into may have been an office sixty years ago. The only light came
            from a battery-powered lantern placed in the middle of an old, wood desk. Two boys stood
            in the corner, shadows amongst a collection of vinyl chairs. The sixties colors of lemon
            yellow and lime green were muted in the dullness.</p>
         <p>Caleb gave them a friendly nod. The taller, dark-haired boy pointed at a doorway.
            “Party’s that way,” he said.</p>
         <p>Another lantern lit a long, narrow hallway with multiple doors. The light didn’t reach
            the end, but the last room on the left emanated an eerie glow. Soft, folk music drifted
            toward them.</p>
         <p>The door beside Caleb jerked open. A boy stuck his shaved head out, smoke billowed
            around him.</p>
         <p>“Hey, Caleb.” He grinned. “I thought I heard the front door slam. Want something to
            drink?”</p>
         <p>“Dex.” Caleb gave him a guy-shake then motioned for her to follow.</p>
         <p>This room wasn’t any bigger than the first. A large peace sign decorated the far wall,
            along with the greeting, Welcome to the Cove. The walls were covered in hundreds of
            names and quotes. She couldn’t read them in the flickering candlelight, but since most
            of them were written in blood-red, the room looked like a scene from Helter Skelter.</p>
         <p>She was beginning to feel like a sacrifice.</p>
         <p>Long tables had been shaped into a T, but there were no chairs. A group of guys and a
            couple girls clustered around the last table, listening to a taller version of shaved
            head, Dex, tell an animated story. A couple faces were recognizable from summer school,
            but Allie wasn’t amongst them.</p>
         <p>She nudged Caleb. “Do you know what they’re talking about?”</p>
         <p>Shrugging, Caleb heaved himself onto the table next to a cooler. He snubbed out the
            candle closest to him. “You want something?”</p>
         <p>“No thanks.”</p>
         <p>The smell of incense burnt her nose. She coughed, then sneezed three times in
            succession. The Dex look-a-like stopped talking and glared at her. One of the girls
            laughed.</p>
         <p>Cassie edged toward the door. “I’ll go see if I can find Allie.”</p>
         <p>“Okay,” Caleb said, with the same puzzled look he’d worn all day. “I’ll be right behind
            you.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The last room on the left resembled a furniture warehouse.</p>
         <p>The moon shone through a wall of tall metal windows and danced off hundreds of plastic
            stars dangled from the ceiling. They swayed in the breeze from the moving bodies below.
            She headed to the windows. Sure enough, they overlooked a body of water, but it wasn’t
            Lake Michigan.</p>
         <p>There were too many people to spot Allie. Cassie pulled out her phone. Hey. I saw your
            car. I’m in this creepy room with stars. Are you here too?</p>
         <p>Furniture had been grouped into private sections, each with its own lantern. Most of the
            areas, she discovered, were occupied by sleeping bodies or couples making out. She even
            stumbled upon an ongoing game of monopoly.</p>
         <p>She was about to give up but a dangling hand, over the arm of a large chair, caught her
            eye. From ten feet away, the tattoos on the fingers were impossible to read, but she
            knew in her heart the letters spelled Take.</p>
         <p>Of course, James was there. She should have known.</p>
         <p>Ignoring the beep from her phone, she stepped to the side for a better view. James sat,
            semi-upright with his head down. He wasn’t awake, and he wasn’t alone. A blonde girl
            gyrated on top of him. The bottom curve of her breasts visible under the hem of her
            midriff shirt.</p>
         <p>Cassie crept closer—but the girl never took her eyes off James. She popped the top
            button on his shirt, then the next.</p>
         <p>Every button the girl undid, twisted something in Cassie’s stomach. With any luck, James
            wore one of his rock t shirts, but when the girl spread his shirt, his chest was
            bare.</p>
         <p>“What are you doing?” Caleb had crept up behind her.</p>
         <p>She pointed to James. “What is wrong with that girl? He isn’t interested.”</p>
         <p>“You’re assuming he's not.”</p>
         <p>“Doesn’t being unconscious qualify as not interested?”</p>
         <p>Caleb huffed. “James is a big boy, and he got along fine before you took this odd
            interest in his wellbeing. You didn’t even want to see him tonight.”</p>
         <p>She hadn’t. But that didn’t mean she wanted to see this, either.</p>
         <p>The girl ran her hands downward, stopping at the button of James’ jeans. She looked
            around lazily before undoing it.</p>
         <p>Cassie clenched her fingers into fists. “Caleb, stop her.” The girl was coming off if
            she had to knock her off, herself. “You know how much he hates to be touched.”</p>
         <p>“I do.” Caleb stared down at her. “The question is, how do you know that?”</p>
         <p>Her cheeks heated. “You… told me.”</p>
         <p>Caleb studied her a few seconds then strode to James. “Get off him.”</p>
         <p>Ignoring Caleb, the girl wrapped her arms around James’ waist. She pressed her head
            against his belly.</p>
         <p>James' eyelids fluttered. “What are you doing, Cassie?”</p>
         <p>He called the girl Cassie.</p>
         <p>Cassie’s stomach gurgled, then rose to the back of her throat. Her knees weakened as a
            red-faced Caleb hooked the girl’s waist and pulled.</p>
         <p>“Go,” he said, then booted James’ legs off the table. “Get up.”</p>
         <p>James jumped to his feet. He swayed back and forth, his chest heaving, until he zeroed
            in on Caleb and visibly relaxed. “What the feck, Cal?” He sunk into the chair and leaned
            forward, head in his hands.</p>
         <p>Caleb strode to her. “Explain why when my best friend thinks he’s about to get his dick
            sucked, he thinks it’s you?”</p>
         <p>Her intake of breath whistled; she couldn’t get enough oxygen. “I… don’t know why.” She
            took his hand. He allowed it, but it lay awkward in her grip</p>
         <p>Caleb pulled her into the hallway, then yanked his hand free. “I’m getting a huge
            headache. Allison’s in there. Can you get a ride with her?”</p>
         <p>“You’re leaving me here?” He couldn’t go. She needed to explain things, or lie about
            things, or sell her soul.</p>
         <p>“I need time to think.” His gaze flicked to her. “Is there something you want to tell
            me? Anything? James won’t lie to me. He won't protect you.”</p>
         <p>She wrapped her arms around herself and shook her head. “No. Nothing… Please, Caleb...
            No one’s at my house. I'm all alone.”</p>
         <p>“Damn it.” He hugged her, but his arms were a loose loop that held no warmth. Stepping
            back, he thrust his chin toward the backroom. “James is fucked-up, and I’m not leaving
            him here. Stay with Allison tonight. She… heard. You can hang with her.”</p>
         <p>“I want to be with you.”</p>
         <p>Caleb headed to the doorway. Turning, he gave her a sad smile. “I believe the exact
            words were you don't want to be alone.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>She took a second to calm her breathing, then stumbled into the room. Allison waited by
            the door alongside her friend, Emily.</p>
         <p>“Are you okay?” Allison asked. “I heard what James said.”</p>
         <p>Cassie couldn’t answer. If she opened her mouth, she might throw up.</p>
         <p>Caleb approached. James followed, shirt undone, eyes downcast. He slumped against the
            wall.</p>
         <p>“So, you’re going to Allison’s?” Caleb confirmed.</p>
         <p>“Yes.” Allison put her arm around Cassie. “It’ll be fun. My parents are at my sister's
            in Crystal Lake. You guys should stop by later.”</p>
         <p>Cassie wanted to shrink into the floor. Like they’d come over now. Neither of them
            wanted anything to do with her.</p>
         <p>“We’ll pass.” Caleb confirmed her worst fear but bumped her hand with his. “I’ll call.
            Just give me some space right now.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Relax,” Allison said when they were alone. She handed Cassie a wrinkled Kleenex from
            her purse. “Things will get straightened out. It’s not like you’ve done something
            wrong.”</p>
         <p>But she did do something wrong. She gambled security for one night with a guy who’d made
            it clear he wasn’t an option.</p>
         <p>Rain hid her tears as she walked down the street. The spot behind Allison’s bug was
            empty. Caleb abandoned her. </p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 34</h4>
         <p>James slid into the passenger seat of Caleb’s car. After a few blocks, it became evident
            Caleb was in no hurry to tell him what happened.</p>
         <p>“If you plan on giving me the silent treatment, let me out here.” He grasped the door
            handle.</p>
         <p>“Don’t even think about bailing on me.” Caleb’s voice contained ice. “You’re coming to
            the pool house.”</p>
         <p>James closed his eyes. That gave him fifteen minutes to straighten his thoughts from the
            pills he’d consumed. Once the fog lifted, he’d deal with wherever this was headed.</p>
         <p>The familiar curb bump signaled their arrival. James made quick work of the door handle,
            then, to buy time, stopped to pee on the pink phlox alongside the fence.</p>
         <p>“Must you use the entire world as your toilet?” Caleb waited in the open doorway.
            “You’ll kill those, and Mom will be mad.”</p>
         <p>“You’re still referring to her as my mom.” James slunk past, into the pool house. “You
            can’t be that angry with me, then.” He turned the TV on. As a peace offering, he
            extended the remote over the chair arm.</p>
         <p>Caleb scoffed. “Your crazy mother may have kept you tied up, so you didn’t learn what
            manners are, but my mother would like her flowers to live.”</p>
         <p>The remote slipped from James’ grasp. It landed, a soft thud on the carpet as he shrank
            back.</p>
         <p>“Fuck.” Caleb groaned. “Forget I said that.”</p>
         <p>James could only nod. For a second he was cuffed to a bed post in darkness so
            suffocating he would beg for a beating instead. He pushed the thought away, back into
            hiding, and gripped the arm rest. Who knew what would come out of Cal’s mouth next. But
            Caleb remained focused on the television, his body taut.</p>
         <p>It seemed all they did was squabble these days.</p>
         <p>Minutes passed. The silence fueled his memories of days alone, the nights blending. At
            least the beatings were faster. If his fingers weren’t dug into the upholstery, he’d
            float to the ceiling. He couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>
         <p>“I'm sorry,” James choked out, “for whatever and everything I've done, tonight and my
            entire effing life. I apologize. Talk to me. Please.”</p>
         <p>“You want me to talk?” Caleb clicked the TV off. “What’s going on between you and
            Cassie?”</p>
         <p>“I don’t…” James swallowed. Everything he should say would be a lie. “I mean… It’s
            not…”</p>
         <p>With each broken sentence, more color faded from Caleb’s cheeks. He lifted his hand.
            “Stop. I don't want to hear anything that will make me hate you.”</p>
         <p>“Don't say that, Callie.”</p>
         <p>“Do you like her?” Caleb stared at him. “Do you understand what it means to like someone
            as opposed to using them?”</p>
         <p>“I'm not that fucked-up. I understand what liking someone means.” He did, didn’t he? He
            could feel stuff. He may have a dissociative disorder; but he wasn’t a psychopath.
            Cassie knew that. She believed in him.</p>
         <p>“I like her, okay.” It was strange to admit out loud. “It's a bit of a surprise to me,
            too.”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s eyes widened. “Are you sober?”</p>
         <p>“Feck off, Cal. I haven’t drank all day.”</p>
         <p>Caleb sighed, long and heavy. “I realize I fooled around on her, so you’ll think I’m
            full of shit, but I like her too. This summer wasn't supposed to go down like this.”</p>
         <p>Deep lines appeared on Caleb’s forehead. He narrowed his eyes. “Cassie knew stuff about
            you. Stuff only I know. Stuff she shouldn’t know unless…”</p>
         <p>James winced. Knowing what was coming didn’t make it easier. “Just ask it already, for
            Christ’s sake.”</p>
         <p>“Did you fuck her?”</p>
         <p>“No. You can relax.”</p>
         <p>“Relax? I’m supposed to be relieved you managed to keep your dick out of my girlfriend?”
            Caleb’s cheeks flushed. “Did you let her touch you?”</p>
         <p>Heat crawled up the back of James’ neck. He pressed his lips together.</p>
         <p>“Oh, no fucking way, James. Don't give me that cryptic look, not after what I went
            through tonight. Has she touched you? I can guess the answer, but I want to hear it from
            you.”</p>
         <p>James nodded. Lying would be pointless. His face was on fire and Caleb could read him
            too well.</p>
         <p>“Fucking perfect.” Caleb seemed to recoil into himself. “You let in my girlfriend. Do
            you have shit for brains?” He lowered his head into his hands.</p>
         <p>James put his hand over his mouth and pressed hard. There was nothing he could do or say
            to make this better.</p>
         <p>Cal’s eyes were wet when he looked up. “Are you trying to hurt me? You’re supposed to be
            my brother.”</p>
         <p>“I won’t touch her again.” The words popped out of James’ mouth before he could process
            what they meant. “She was hurt, the night you didn’t show at that party—and started
            drinking. That pretty much nullifies everything, doesn’t it?”</p>
         <p>He broke the confines of the chair and leapt to his feet, so quickly Caleb jerked back.
            The bottle of Jäger he’d stashed was still behind a stack of old DVDs. He gulped a
            drink.</p>
         <p>Caleb eyed him from the sofa, brows raised.</p>
         <p>Wherever he went, people dissected him. Except Cassie. She accepted him, no questions
            asked. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Stop examining me.”</p>
         <p>“I can’t believe you let her touch you.” Caleb sighed. “I'd be ecstatic—if we weren’t
            talking about my girlfriend.”</p>
         <p>James set the bottle in front of Caleb and paced into the kitchen.</p>
         <p>“I thought you hated her,” Caleb said, “you didn’t even want her around.”</p>
         <p>“Why are we still discussing this?”</p>
         <p>“Oh. I get it.” Caleb took a drink then placed the bottle in the freezer. “You didn't
            want her around because you liked her—not because you hated her.”</p>
         <p>James picked up the lacrosse ball from the top of a mesh basket of assorted sports
            equipment. He bounced it hard against the wall. No matter which way this conversation
            went, he’d lose.</p>
         <p>“Wow,” Caleb huffed. “At least some of your comments make sense now.”</p>
         <p>He whipped the ball again. It smashed into a picture of dogs playing pool, sending glass
            everywhere. He resumed pacing, but his knees were spongy.</p>
         <p>“Calm down.” Caleb stepped in front of him, his voice laced with the worried tone James
            found comforting and aggravating. “Don't freak out.”</p>
         <p>James pushed past. “Stop worrying about me. I'm not some fragile nut case.”</p>
         <p>“You’re acting like one.”</p>
         <p>Sighing, James plopped onto the sofa.</p>
         <p>Caleb sat beside him. “Remember when you first moved in with us?”</p>
         <p>Tracing circles on his knee, he nodded. He had no idea where this was headed, but
            anywhere away from the current topic would work.</p>
         <p>“Mom kept that journal. She was always watching you for signs of suicidal behavior.”</p>
         <p>Those days burnt holes in James’ memory. He’d been haunted back then. He would
            disappear, sending Caleb’s mom into waves of panic until they found him hiding in some
            random closet—and Cal would climb in and sit beside him.</p>
         <p>He groaned. “Go to feckin hell, Callie. I’m not gonna kill myself over a girl.” But it
            wasn’t cool his current behavior reminded Cal of his darkest days.</p>
         <p>“Bros before hoes,” he spat the words out before he could change his mind. “I said I
            won’t touch her.”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s eyebrows lifted. “We're not in middle school anymore. This is too serious to be
            summed up in a cliché.”</p>
         <p>“No. It’s not. Family comes first.” He reached over to knuckle-bump Caleb.</p>
         <p>Grunting, Caleb complied. “What do we do now? No one gets her?”</p>
         <p>“Nah. You like her, she likes you.” He spoke fast, wanting to be done with it. “You’re
            the one who cultivated this all summer. Besides, she doesn't want me. Girls never, you
            know, really want me.”</p>
         <p>“But you're into her. That’s a first.”</p>
         <p>“I may like her a bit,” James allowed. He walked to the window and stared into the
            blackness. “But all I did was console her over you.”</p>
         <p>He picked up his tortured expression in the reflection of the glass, then Caleb’s image
            behind him, looking skeptical.</p>
         <p>Caleb shook his head. “You’re sure you’re okay?”</p>
         <p>“I’m always okay.” Unable to face Caleb, he lit a smoke. “You were right. I ruined this
            for you.”</p>
         <p>“When did I say that?”</p>
         <p>“At that shoot. When you told me about, Cassie.” The words haunted him.</p>
         <p>Caleb held his fingers up, requesting the smoke, then took a long pull. “I don’t
            remember that, and you haven’t ruined anything.”</p>
         <p>James lit another cigarette. “Am I forgiven?”</p>
         <p>“Forgiven.” Caleb shifted. “How much does Cassie know about you? Give me a heads
            up.”</p>
         <p>“Some.” James shrugged. “Not much. Maybe you should tell her.”</p>
         <p>“Tell her what?”</p>
         <p>“What a fuck up I am. She’d never speak to me again, which would solve a lot of
            problems.”</p>
         <p>Caleb stubbed his cigarette out. “You're not fucked-up—and I'm out of answers. I'm going
            to bed. My brain’s scrambled.”</p>
         <p>“Cassie looked really upset.” James turned back to the window. “Are you going to call
            her?”</p>
         <p>“Not tonight, but yeah. Thanks for being okay with it.” The door clicked shut.</p>
         <p>“No problem,” James said to no one. He pressed his forehead against the cool glass and
            shut his eyes. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 35</h4>
         <p>James swept the broken glass into a dustpan and deposited the shards in the metal
            garbage bin in the garage. Then he washed dishes, put away laundry, and showered. No
            matter what he did, Cassie’s lost expression stayed with him.</p>
         <p>He stripped, then stretched across the sofa, the volume in his earbuds loud enough to
            block out any thoughts of her alone and crying, but even his playlist reminded him of
            her. He threw the earbuds across the room. If he wanted peace, he’d have to drink
            himself to sleep.</p>
         <p>One mouthful of Jäger failed to sooth his wired brain. What the hell was he thinking,
            promising to stay away from Cassie? Was that even possible? He replaced the bottle and
            slammed the freezer door. He didn’t want to get drunk. What he wanted was three, maybe
            four blocks away. An easy run, even in the rain.</p>
         <p>He promised Caleb he wouldn’t touch her. He never said he wouldn’t see her.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James wiped water from his eyes and surveyed Allison’s brick two story. This may be
            daft, but after coming this far he had no intention of going back. He strode up the
            winding path and knocked.</p>
         <p>Cold air washed over him as Allison opened the door. Her eyes widened. Behind her,
            Emily’s mouth hung agape.</p>
         <p>“Is Cassie here?” Breathing hard, James braced his arms on either side of the door frame
            and leaned forward enough Allison backed into Emily. “Can I come in? It's raining.”</p>
         <p>He stepped inside as Cassie rounded the corner. She blinked in surprise, then checked
            through the sidelight, window accenting the door. Her gaze rested on the far wall before
            she spoke. “How did you get here?”</p>
         <p>“I ran.” She didn’t look happy to see him, something he hadn’t considered. “I wanted to
            check on you.”</p>
         <p>Allison broke into a wide grin. “You ran four blocks… in the rain… to check on Cassie.
            Caleb’s girlfriend, Cassie?”</p>
         <p>“No wonder you're soaked.” Emily pointed to his sweatshirt.</p>
         <p>Water seeped from the material and pooled in his shoes. He pulled the shirt over his
            head and mopped his chest.</p>
         <p>Three sets of eyes watched.</p>
         <p>“You don't mind that I took this off, do you?” He held the dripping garment over the
            doormat, and scanned Allison for affirmation.</p>
         <p>“She doesn’t mind.” Emily stared at his midsection. “Your shorts are wet too.”</p>
         <p>“Emily.” Allison plucked the shirt from James’ hand. “Stop trying to strip him
            naked.”</p>
         <p>He didn’t care. Cassie’s friends were free to discuss his attire and stare holes through
            him all night, if they wished. Cassie’s steady gaze pulled in his entire focus. She
            stepped toward him; arm raised. For a second it looked like she might slap him, but she
            tugged up the low riding waistband of his shorts.</p>
         <p>“Er...” Allison grabbed Emily’s arm and tugged her from the entrance. “We’ll put this in
            the dryer.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie’s hand slipped from his hip. She lifted her head, about to speak, but they had a
            limited amount of time, and he didn’t plan on wasting it being told what he did wrong.
            Fisting her shirt, he pulled her closer, crushing his lips against hers, his promise not
            to touch—forgotten.</p>
         <p>She hesitated, then wrapped her arms around him, kissing him back. He pinned her flat
            against the damask wallpaper, tension melting from his body. She wanted him. Their lips
            parted. He slid his hands down her arms and nestled the top of her head under his
            chin.</p>
         <p>Her contented sigh warmed the base of his throat. “You smell good.”</p>
         <p>“What do I smell like?” Between his midnight jog and stress, his body was jacked. He
            ought to smell like sweat.</p>
         <p>“Night air and summer rain—and you,” she said, “I love the smell of you.”</p>
         <p>He tightened his grip and kissed the top of her head, satin under his lips. His heart
            pounded like a mad drummer.</p>
         <p>She searched his face. “Where's Caleb?”</p>
         <p>The words made him step back. “At home. What went on tonight?”</p>
         <p>“He didn't tell you?”</p>
         <p>“Not exactly. He asked if something happened between us.”</p>
         <p>“What did you say?”</p>
         <p>“I said…” He paused, conflicted. “I said we had a moment when you were upset about him,
            and I comforted you. But that was it.” Unable to control himself, he reached out to play
            with her hair.</p>
         <p>“James, you said my name when some girl was trying to… to get it on with you. You
            thought she was me.”</p>
         <p>That was what he’d done? It was so stupid he almost laughed.</p>
         <p>“Did you hear me?” she said, “you said my name. You thought she was me.”</p>
         <p>“I wished she was you.” It was a heartfelt confession, but Cassie only drew her brows
            together.</p>
         <p>Heat stung his neck. “Cal’s cool,” he said, “I promised I would stay away from you.” He
            tried to pull her closer. “Come here, angel. Warm me up.”</p>
         <p>“This is your idea of staying away?”</p>
         <p>“Shh.” He put a finger to her lips and scanned the direction the girls went.</p>
         <p>She slapped his hand. “You said I meant nothing to you, and now you have the nerve to
            say you wished that girl had been me? What are you thinking?”</p>
         <p>James backed up until the opposite wall stopped him. He slumped against it. Cassie
            wanted tangible evidence of how he felt. Something he’d never be able to verbalize out
            loud with words.</p>
         <p>He thumped the back of his head against the wall. “What do you want me to say? That I
            want you to leave Cal. For me?” He could never say that. “Caleb’s my brother.”</p>
         <p>The disappointment in her features crumpled his heart.</p>
         <p>“Forget it.” Cassie crossed her arms. “This has cost me enough.”</p>
         <p>Voices neared, Allison talking loud enough to be heard before seen. The girls appeared
            around the corner, Allison in pajama pants and a robe, Emily in booty shorts and a
            cami.</p>
         <p>Emily handed James a plush purple towel. “Jeez, Cassie, why are you still in the hall?
            Aren't you going to invite him in?”</p>
         <p>Emily grabbed his hand. He glanced at Cassie, but she turned away, so he allowed Emily
            to drag him into the living room and push him onto a velvet loveseat.</p>
         <p>“Emily!” Allison’s hands rose to her cheeks. “His shorts are wet. He can't sit on the
            upholstery.”</p>
         <p>James tried to stand but Emily pressed his shoulder. “He’s fine, Allie. You're the one
            who insisted he keep his pants on.”</p>
         <p>With a groan, Allison stomped past Cassie who, appearing indifferent, hovered in the
            living room doorway.</p>
         <p>James smiled. “If you want me naked, just ask.” He had no intention of stripping naked,
            but fuck everybody who wanted to play with his head. He lifted his hips and lowered his
            shorts a few inches to prove his point. It would almost be worth pulling them off to see
            the expression on their faces.</p>
         <p>Allison returned with another towel. “Sit on this.” She handed him the furry blanket
            from the end of the sofa. Happy for the warmth, he pulled the blanket over himself.</p>
         <p>She cranked the volume on the TV and tossed him the remote. “Make yourself at home,
            James. It’s time for a girl chat.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie followed her friends into the large kitchen and leaned cross armed against the
            counter.</p>
         <p>“What are you doing?” Allison directed the question to Emily. “You promised me you’d
            mellow out.”</p>
         <p>“I know, but he looked so sad and cold.”</p>
         <p>“He’s here because of Cassie?” Allison pointed to her. “The guy ran here, in the rain,
            for her.”</p>
         <p>Cassie inspected her blush pink nail polish. James did come to see her. Although after
            their conversation, she couldn’t fathom why.</p>
         <p> “Stop staring at your manicure.” Emily glared at her. “Remind Allie that you’re into
            Caleb. You don't care what I do with James.”</p>
         <p>Cassie nodded. “I have no idea why he’s here. Emily can do whatever she wants.”</p>
         <p>“See?” Emily's smile grew. “He’s all mine.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Jeez, James,” Emily said as she slid under James’ blanket, “you’re as pale as a
            ghost.”</p>
         <p>Ignoring James’ stare, Cassie proceeded to the farthest chair. She didn’t care what he
            did. She gave him the opportunity to step up, and he failed. Emily could have him.</p>
         <p>“Push play, please,” Allison said, “we just started a movie.”</p>
         <p>James reached for the controller, the same time as Emily.</p>
         <p>“Sorry,” she said, her hand still on his.</p>
         <p>“It's cool.” James smiled his come-hither smile, his voice smooth. “I’ve seen this movie
            at least five times.” He spit out the next line on cue, proof of how well he knew it.
            “How ‘bout you, Cassie? Has Cal made you watch this?”</p>
         <p>Cassie kept her eyes on the screen. “We do other things.”</p>
         <p>It was the last thing he said to her. Instead, he continued spitting out line after line
            in such an impressive manner he became more entertaining than the movie itself. Cassie’s
            shoulders ached from tension, and so did her head. If Allison wasn’t in her pajamas,
            she’d ask for a ride home.</p>
         <p>With a few minutes left of the movie, Allison retrieved a pillow and a folded blanket.
            “Here, Cassie,” she said, “I’m going to bed. You can have the sofa—when it’s empty.”</p>
         <p>It was obvious Emily had no intention of moving anytime soon. As soon as Allison
            disappeared, Emily clicked off the table light beside her and looped her arms around
            James' neck. She pulled him downward; and he allowed it.</p>
         <p>Cassie stomped to the window. Lightning split the northern sky, but the rain had broken
            into a light drizzle. Now might be her only chance to escape.</p>
         <p>“What are you looking at her for?” Emily’s voice floated through the dark room.</p>
         <p>“Don't let me interfere.” Cassie waltzed past them. “I’m leaving.”</p>
         <p>She’d rather get struck by lightning than stay. </p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 36</h4>
         <p>“I have to go.” He should never have gone to Allison’s. Attempting to make himself feel
            better, he made Cassie feel worse. He maneuvered out from under Emily and swung his feet
            to the floor.</p>
         <p>Emily glowered at him. “Are you kidding? You're chasing after Cassie? I should tell
            Caleb you showed up here tonight.”</p>
         <p>“Tell him whatever you want.” It wasn’t like Caleb would believe anything Emily said. He
            snatched a throw pillow off the floor and threw it at her, then paused. “Chill out, it’s
            late. I can’t let her walk by herself, can I?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>Thanks to a blanket of dense fog, James couldn’t see shit. He jumped off the front step
            and headed in the most likely route Cassie would take—toward her house. After a couple
            of blocks he caught sight of her silhouette moving through the mist.</p>
         <p>“Cassie! Wait!” He sprinted forward and fell into step behind her. When she refused to
            stop, he yanked her elbow. “I said hold up.”</p>
         <p>She jerked around. “Let go of me.”</p>
         <p>Despite her weak attempts to free herself, he secured her against his bare chest.</p>
         <p>She settled in the crook of his arms. “I know it makes no sense, but it’s hard to watch
            you kiss other girls.”</p>
         <p>“I overheard what you said in the kitchen. I thought you wanted me to.”</p>
         <p>“I did, until I saw it happen. I'm so messed up right now.” She snuggled closer, her
            cheek a patch of heat against his bare skin. “Does it make you crazy to watch me kiss
            Caleb?”</p>
         <p>“It drives me mad.”</p>
         <p>She gazed up at him, her face tear streaked, and shuddered against him. “I don’t want to
            be alone. Can I go home with you?”</p>
         <p>He opened his mouth, intent on protesting, but she sucked the words off his tongue. She
            slid her fingers under the loose waistband of his shorts and yanked him closer,
            devouring his mouth. Her breasts flattened against his chest as her hips pushed into
            his. The movement weakened his knees and hardened his muscles. He secured her hips to
            stop the onslaught of sensations, but pressing her against him, didn’t help.</p>
         <p>He stepped back to catch his breath, hungry for more and way too turned on. It was
            impossible to avoid where this was headed and too exhausting to keep trying.</p>
         <p>“Walk, Cassie,” he instructed, his voice low, words crisp. “We’re going to my
            place.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>By the time they reached his apartment, there was a detectable change in her expression.
            Enough to make him pause. He snugged her against the wooden siding and let raindrops
            from the overhang cool his back.</p>
         <p>“If you want,” he offered, “I’ll get you my coat and walk you back to Caleb’s. Although
            I wouldn't recommend bugging him right now.”</p>
         <p>“If I texted him, would he talk to me?”</p>
         <p>“Do you want him to?”</p>
         <p>Shrugging, she tried to pull him closer, but he planted his palms flat, on either side
            of her head. As bad as he craved her, she had to want him back. Him. Nobody else.</p>
         <p>“Where do you want to be, Cassie? Right now, this second, who do you want to be with?”
            He held his breath.</p>
         <p>She tilted her head, eyes half-closed. “With you.”</p>
         <p>Pressing his forehead against hers, he swallowed hard. Tonight, she belonged to him. He
            would deal with tomorrow, later.</p>
         <p>Her wet top barely concealed what was underneath—and taunted him long enough. He grabbed
            hold of the bottom of it and yanked, sending buttons flying.</p>
         <p>“My blouse!” With a nervous smile, she attempted to pull both sides together, he hoisted
            her hands above her head so she couldn’t cover up.</p>
         <p>Her chest heaved as he fumbled his keys out of his pocket with his free hand, then
            leaned slightly to slip the key into the lock. He nudged the door open with his foot,
            the descent into the basement, dark.</p>
         <p>She whimpered.</p>
         <p>“Still okay?” He loosened his grip on her wrists.</p>
         <p>She nodded.</p>
         <p>He leaned in to kiss her. Slower, this time, enjoying how her mouth fit his, learning
            what he could do to make her kiss harder. She hummed when he stroked her lower back, and
            held her breath when he dipped his head, lips near her naked breasts.</p>
         <p>Too many clothes blocked where he needed to be. He hoisted her up; her legs wrapped
            around him instinctively.</p>
         <p>“Hold on. We’re moving.” He bounced her into a firm hold and navigated through the
            door.</p>
         <p>Darkness made the stairs perilous. She buried her head against his neck and, drew his
            earlobe into her mouth. Stopping mid-way, he gripped the wooden railing.</p>
         <p>“Stairs,” he whispered, hoping she would understand her mouth in that position—or any
            position—made it difficult for him to concentrate on not killing them.</p>
         <p>He managed to unlock the door to his room and laid her crossways on his bed. He
            collapsed on top of her and kissed the bottom of her throat before heading downward.
            Their fingers laced as he traced her nipple with his tongue. If he kept this up, his
            face would be buried between her legs in no time.</p>
         <p>Sure, he could make her cum; he seemed to have a talent for that. Then he would fuck her
            from behind, like all the faceless others. An impersonal dance, not at all what he
            wanted.</p>
         <p>He rolled onto his side to study her. She faced him and smiled.</p>
         <p>“Shower with me.” He never showered with a girl, but it seemed like an effective way to
            slow the night down.</p>
         <p>Cassie nodded, so he headed to the bathroom to turn the water on. She was still on the
            bed when he re-entered the room. Her lidded eyes drank in his every move.</p>
         <p>“Jaysus, Cassie. You are hotter than Hades.” He kneeled over her, then paused, his
            fingers on the button of her pants.</p>
         <p>“Take them off if they bother you,” she whispered, “that’s what you said when you let me
            strip you. Remember?”</p>
         <p>How could he forget. With a shaky breath, he undid the button, then the zipper. He
            pulled her pants off, inside out, leaving her panties in place.</p>
         <p>Wanting to broaden his view, he stood back.</p>
         <p>Her eyes widened, yet she trusted him enough to be here, despite what she went through
            with that asshole in Kansas. The one he already had the address of.</p>
         <p>Her hair folded over her shoulders as she got up. “I’m okay, James. I trust you. Don’t
            look so terrified.”</p>
         <p>Her faith in him made the sexual thoughts going through his head seem vile. He pointed
            to the bathroom, “Go in. I'll be right behind you.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Lying on his bed, James attempted to regulate his breathing. When it came to sex, he was
            more aggressive than Caleb. What if he scared her? Scared her—hell, his hands were
            shaking. He had a naked girl in his shower. One that wasn’t his to have. One that
            somehow maneuvered her way into his life—and into his heart.</p>
         <p>He needed to think of something, anything other than her naked, wet body. Stepping into
            the shower already at attention seemed rude, but after a few minutes the lure was too
            strong to resist.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“I thought you flaked on me,” she said when the bathroom door clicked shut.</p>
         <p>Despite the steam, he could make her body out, through the muted glass. He gripped the
            counter. Cassie may be sort of single, but this was wrong. He should put her in a taxi
            and send her home.</p>
         <p>“Are you coming? I’m lonely here by myself.” She opened the door, crumbling the last of
            his resolve.</p>
         <p>He stepped out of his bottoms and into the shower, allowing her to pull him under the
            hot water. Though he kept his hands at his sides, she snuggled against him for a few
            seconds then stepped back and gazed at him in earnest.</p>
         <p>“I'm screwed. I don't want anyone else playing with this.” She motioned to his hard on,
            which he had given up trying to control. “Or kissing this.” She pulled him forward and
            kissed his bottom lip. “Which isn’t fair, because you have to watch me with Caleb. That
            sucks for you, doesn’t it?”</p>
         <p>He already told her he despised it, and that thought was too evil to continue admitting
            out loud. Exhaling, he gave her the logical answer. “I have to be okay with it.”</p>
         <p>No matter how she phrased the question, he couldn’t supply the answer she dug for. He
            would never say, leave Caleb for me.</p>
         <p>She didn’t press. Smiling slightly, she pivoted toward the tiles. “Can you wash my
            back.”</p>
         <p>When he didn’t move, she arched her spine. Her bottom bobbed toward him and his heart
            flipped. When he was with Cassie, nothing else and nobody else mattered. This was wrong,
            but it didn’t feel wrong, and it was extra wrong that he didn’t care.</p>
         <p>He moved her hair and whispered behind her ear, “are you sure you want to do this? I
            can't give you anything more.”</p>
         <p>“I know.” She turned to blink up at him. “I’m a bit afraid, but I want to experience
            you.”</p>
         <p>He wanted to tell her how much he needed her, but too much blood had left his brain and
            the words wouldn’t come. Besides, her eyes were sad, like she already knew.</p>
         <p>“I'm glad I'm sober,” he said, hoping she’d know that one sentence conveyed everything
            he couldn’t express.</p>
         <p>Nodding, she ran her fingers along his cheek. He kissed her palm—then placed her hand on
            himself—silent permission to touch. Showing instead of telling, how much she meant to
            him.</p>
         <p>He closed his eyes, letting the shower pound his hair around his face. When he opened
            them, Cassie was watching him.</p>
         <p>“What?” He pushed his hair back.</p>
         <p>“I love the look on your face right now,” she said, her hand still stroking. “Your
            pupils are huge. I can only see small rings of green.”</p>
         <p>He bet his pupils were blown. She was lucky he hadn’t dissolved at her feet and
            disappeared down the drain with the water. He braced his arm against the tiles. “You’re
            doing an excellent job at that.”</p>
         <p>“I like my hands on you.”</p>
         <p>“I like your hands on me, too.” Pulling his hips back, he slipped out of her grasp.
            Another minute and he’d explode into a million pieces.</p>
         <p>Her skin glistened under the water, smooth and inviting. “Let me touch you.”</p>
         <p>He spooned her against him and slid his free hand over her body. The flatness of her
            stomach, the curve of her hips. Deep between her thighs, he played her like one of his
            most treasured guitars, until she moaned, weak in his arms, and the heat coming off her
            body rivaled the temperature of the water.</p>
         <p>Unable to stand it, he flipped her around, her back against the tile, and ground against
            her.</p>
         <p>She rose onto her toes, one leg around him, but slipping into her in that position would
            be next to impossible. He opened the door. The next second, they were on the floor, half
            on his bath mat, the cold tile refreshing.</p>
         <p>Pinning her wrists on either side of her head, he sucked on her bottom lip. She squirmed
            under him. Her hips bucked upward, telling him she wanted him, as bad as he wanted
            her—and he let it happen.</p>
         <p>He merged into her with no help from his hands; a perfect joining, like he belonged. The
            connection so complete, he stopped moving and opened his eyes. Hers were already
            open.</p>
         <p>She grinned. “You're smirking.”</p>
         <p>“And you’re beautiful.” Nothing had come close to feeling like this. He drove himself in
            deeper, studying her face.</p>
         <p>Cassie gasped, lashes fluttering. His heart fluttered along with them. He kissed her
            forehead, his body back in motion.</p>
         <p>“Let go of my arms.” She strained against his grip. “I want to touch you.”</p>
         <p>Without hesitation, he released her. So what if she saw his scars, visible under the
            honest bulbs in his bathroom fixtures? So what if she asked about them? He’d give her
            the best answer he could, at least the bits he remembered. The scars were part of his
            history and he wanted her to know all about him. Anything less would be cheating her
            somehow.</p>
         <p>He propped himself up, elbows on either side of her, while her fingertips traced his
            contours.</p>
         <p>She wrapped her legs around him. “How long can I keep you like this?”</p>
         <p>“Is coinnigh mé go deo.” She could keep him forever.</p>
         <p>His thoughts would only come to him in Irish. She wouldn’t understand, and he may not be
            making sense. The warmth of her skin, the pressure of her hand, her legs around him,
            made speech and time meaningless abstracts. His boundaries blurred to merge with the
            body under him. He wanted to put his mark on every piece of her.</p>
         <p>“Cassie, let me free.” The words spilled out of him; his voice strained.</p>
         <p>“What?”</p>
         <p>She sounded as out of focus as he’d been. Shit. He needed her to move, now.</p>
         <p>“Undo your legs. I'm gonna explode.”</p>
         <p>Instead of releasing him she lifted her hips, sinking him farther inside her. “I want to
            feel you.”</p>
         <p>“Cassie.” His voice broke. What was she thinking? “Are you on the pill?”</p>
         <p>Getting Cal’s girlfriend pregnant would be beyond the stupidest thing he could do.
            “Please.” He bit his lip, hard. </p>
         <p>She unlocked her legs, granting his freedom.</p>
         <p>“Give me your hand.” He grabbed her hand and wrapped her fingers around his penis. “You
            wanted to…” The words came out garbled as he reached the end of his control.</p>
         <p>A few moments of silence went by. His breathing evened out. He checked her
            expression.</p>
         <p>“Ew.” She extended her palm, nose wrinkled.</p>
         <p>“You said you wanted to feel me.” Heat flushed his cheeks. That was the most intimate
            thing he’d ever shared. Cal would never believe it… but Cal would never know.</p>
         <p>A smile crept across her face. “That was pretty cool.” She tipped her hand upside down
            as if she tested the consistency. “What do I do with this?” She tried to wipe her hand
            on his shoulder. “You can have it back.”</p>
         <p>“No.” He scrambled away. “Keep it. It's a present from me.”</p>
         <p>Cassie burst out laughing. “Tell me you're not grossed out by your own cum?”</p>
         <p>“It's usually in a nice little package. Not out there for discussion.” Not that he spoke
            to the others.</p>
         <p>He stepped into the shower and studied her. That had undeniably been the best feeling
            he'd ever had—and he’d completely fucked over Caleb. Worse, it was almost worth his
            breach of loyalty. He’d end up alone, with no family, and he deserved it.</p>
         <p>A shiver ran down his spine. He focused on the water running over his body and kept his
            sight on Cassie who watched him from the bathmat. He beckoned through the open door.
            “It’s still hot.”</p>
         <p>“In a moment. I’m enjoying the show. Do a circle, you know, like a model.” She drew a
            circle in the air.</p>
         <p>Obeying, he turned around, stood for a second, then faced her. A basic pose—one elbow
            bent, one arm resting over his hip bone—modelling 101. His arm brushed the long scar,
            low on his left side, concealed under his Niʹ Bhrisfear Meʹ tattoo, and just like that,
            the smell of copper and well-water filled his nose.</p>
         <p>His stepdad held him in the empty tub, naked, shoulders flat against the curved bottom,
            the yellowed sides rising high above him.</p>
         <p>“Prove to me you love me more,” his stepdad said, placing a worn wooden knife handle in
            his mother’s hands. The safety clicked from the Browning Hi-Power pistol he polished
            daily. “Cut him.”</p>
         <p>His mom lifted the knife. “It’s okay, James.” She drew the blade down his side. “The
            sign of the cross,” she said. “I'm letting the devil out. When it heals over, his door
            is sealed. He'll never get back inside you.”</p>
         <p>The knife clattered onto the cast iron beside him. His mother's fingers gripped the
            curved edge of the tub, a constellation of tiny red pinpricks traveled up her arm. Her
            eyes filled with tears. She was always crying it seemed.</p>
         <p>Laughing, his stepdad flicked ashes on him, courtesy of his ever-present Jin Lings, the
            heater of which was one of his favored forms of punishment.</p>
         <p>They left him there, in the dark.</p>
         <p>Shaking the hair off his face, James glanced out his shower door. His tub was empty of
            course, the room warm and well-lit.</p>
         <p>“You did that turn really well. Bravo.” Cassie clapped a few times. “You looked just
            like a model… Are you okay?”</p>
         <p>Was he? A piece of him just clicked into place. He could recall the events of that night
            with perfect clarity—but no emotion.</p>
         <p>Too scared to move, he fell asleep praying his spilled blood was enough to satisfy his
            stepdad's anger, and his mom wasn’t getting beat in the next room. Once his stepdad
            passed out, his mom came and got him. She always did. She bandaged him up and held him
            on the icy bathroom floor. “It was an accident,” she said, over and over.</p>
         <p>James backed under the water and fumbled for the shampoo. After a minute, he peered out
            to check on Cassie.</p>
         <p>Wrinkles creased her forehead. “James. Are you sure you’re okay? You sort of zoned out
            on me for a second. You can talk to me.”</p>
         <p>He smiled. “Just too hot.”</p>
         <p>The amazing thing was he wasn’t zoning out, just remembering. He yawned. Like a machine
            winding down, he needed to retreat.</p>
         <p>He stepped out of the shower and grabbed a towel. “Clean up and come to bed.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Visions of his mother ravaged his brain as he crawled under the sheet. The way she
            looked at him the last time he laid eyes on her. She’d been released into a halfway
            house, and he convinced Caleb to take him there. Caleb insisted it was a bad idea but
            did it anyway.</p>
         <p>He wasn’t supposed to visit. But he was turning sixteen and wanted to see her face when
            he told her he sought emancipation. He needed to see for himself if she cared; then
            didn’t know how to respond when it became clear he’d broken her.</p>
         <p>Caleb was right. It had been a bad idea. He cried like a baby the entire ride home,
            while Caleb white-knuckled the steering wheel, swearing.</p>
         <p>His mom hung herself that night.</p>
         <p>That’s where his memory duped him. The weeks after stretched like a blank canvas he
            couldn’t get ink on. But he was sure of one thing. Caleb never left his side. </p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 37</h4>
         <p>James was the last person Cassie expected to show up at Allison’s, but the fact he did,
            told her more than he would ever admit.</p>
         <p>Shivering, she turned off the shower. She had no regrets—other than she was sure she was
            in love with a guy she could never have—and was messing up the relationship with the guy
            she might still have a chance with.</p>
         <p>She dried off and stepped into the bedroom. Unsure how to navigate the situation, she
            hovered. He got lost on her somehow in the shower, and she wasn’t sure how to bring him
            back.</p>
         <p>James motioned toward the dresser at the foot of his bed, his movement lazy. “Do you
            want a tee to sleep in? The folded ones are clean.”</p>
         <p>A short stack of shirts sat on top of the dresser. She pulled the top one on. “What are
            you wearing?”</p>
         <p>“Nothing. I can put something on if it bugs you.”</p>
         <p>“I'm good.” She wormed under the warmth of his arm. He let her but seemed sullen.
            Perhaps he wanted her to leave?</p>
         <p>“I don't know how much sleep I can get,” she said, then waited a few seconds. “I’ll need
            to go soon.”</p>
         <p>His arm tightened around her. “Maybe I won't let you go. I might hold you hostage.”</p>
         <p>“Why would you do that?” It was another attempt at getting him to say he wanted her—even
            though she promised herself to enjoy their remaining time together and not push him. He
            made his intentions clear, repeatedly.</p>
         <p>He sighed and shifted closer. “Then I could have you whenever I desired.”</p>
         <p>The words were a far cry from the—I want you bad enough to risk everything—she needed to
            hear. She drew back a couple inches. “This isn't a game anymore.”</p>
         <p>His body tensed, but other than a slight change in his breathing pattern, he remained
            quiet.</p>
         <p>Deciding to play along, she poked him. “How would you keep me here? Would you tie me
            up?”</p>
         <p>“I would never tie you up.”</p>
         <p>Tightness in his voice made her twist to see his face. His expression became guarded. He
            let go of her and tried to flip to his belly.</p>
         <p>“James.” She intercepted his roll, so that he was on his side, facing her. “You hide
            when you’re avoiding something. Talk to me.”</p>
         <p>Silently, he picked up her hand and rubbed her finger on the tattoos circling his
            wrist.</p>
         <p>“Feel anything?” he whispered.</p>
         <p>“I know about the scars,” she said, just as quiet.</p>
         <p>“What about them?”</p>
         <p>“When you were in the hospital, the doctors thought you tried… tried to hurt yourself.
            They strapped you on the table in case you—” Cassie struggled to recall an evening she’d
            done her best to forget. “It was the straps. Caleb wanted me to stay with you. He
            worried you would freak out if you woke up alone; and couldn’t move. He wanted me to
            give the hospital another name, your real name.”</p>
         <p>“What happened when you did?”</p>
         <p>“The doctor disappeared. I think he made some calls. When he came back, he unstrapped
            you, and dragged me into the hallway to give me shit about not giving the right
            information, earlier.”</p>
         <p>“Cassie, I need you to stop talking.” He made a weak attempt at pulling his wrist away,
            but she held tight and he relented. “It's not you. I just need to turn off for a bit.”
            He sounded wrung out.</p>
         <p>“Okay.” She brought his hand to her lips and kissed the scars. “Get some sleep.”</p>
         <p>She traced circles over his wrist with her thumb. Something didn’t sit right. She
            brought his wrist closer, trying to see in the dimness of the bathroom light. The
            tattoos did a decent job of concealing damage from her eyes, but her fingers told a
            different story.</p>
         <p>Scarring clustered around the sides of his wrist, not on the soft underside where veins
            are visible. She ran her fingers over his wrist bones again, then inhaled a sharp
            breath.</p>
         <p>He’d been tied up. She wanted to scream, 'Who did this to you,' although she already
            knew. Caleb told her from the get-go. James’ parents were wack jobs. All he got from
            them was a ton of cash and a screwed-up head.</p>
         <p>Her breath caught. Tattoos covered a lot of his body.</p>
         <p>Eyelids squeezed tight; she drifted her fingers along his arm. It didn't take long to
            locate more divots, some worse than others. She laid his arm down, not able to take
            anymore. A tear rolled down her cheek and dripped off her nose.</p>
         <p>“Cigarettes,” he said in a voice, barely audible. He inched over, aligning his body to
            hers. “Don't cry, angel. I'm okay now.”</p>
         <p>She met his eyes but had no clue how to respond.</p>
         <p>“See.” He sort-of laughed. “My no touch rules are there for a reason. It's not cool to
            make a girl cry after having great sex with her.”</p>
         <p>His attempts at joking hurt more. She swallowed the lump in her throat.</p>
         <p>“Sleep now,” he said in a pleading tone that clearly meant, don’t ask any more
            questions. A request she had no problem filling.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>She listened to James’ steady breathing as the gravity of what he exposed exploded in
            layers throughout her head.</p>
         <p>For the first time Caleb's crazy, protective behavior made sense. And so did the
            warnings to stay away. They were for James good; not hers. She got out of bed and
            borrowed a piece of paper and a pen from the top of his dresser.</p>
         <p>With no idea what to write, she stared at the blank paper. Even if she knew how to help
            him, he made it clear he could only offer her one night, and she’d willingly accepted.
            What he told her after didn't change those words.</p>
         <p>She penned, Thanks for the night, and folded the paper.</p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 38</h4>
         <p>A stream of sunlight illuminated the empty spot beside James; Cassie vanished—again.
            Raking his fingers through his hair, he organized his thoughts. Last night’s
            recollection of being cut, felt no more real than it did in the shower, but sex with
            Cassie remained deliciously tangible.</p>
         <p>His phone beeped. There were seven text messages, all from Cal, all with the same thread
            of concern.</p>
         <p>Where are you?</p>
         <p>Are you okay?</p>
         <p>Call me.</p>
         <p>There were no messages from Cassie explaining her departure. He tossed his phone onto
            the nightstand. It thudded against the lamp.</p>
         <p>“Fuck.” Breaking his phone was the last thing he needed. He leaned over to check it. A
            folded piece of paper, a fancy J scrolled across the front, peeked out from under the
            lamp base.</p>
         <p>“Thanks for the night,” he read aloud. The night. “What the fuck?” Sure, he said one
            night was all he could give her, but she could at least have woken him up to say
            goodbye.</p>
         <p>He flung the crumpled paper across the room, then dialed Caleb. “What do you effing
            want?”</p>
         <p>Caleb sighed, the type of sigh that accompanies the words thank God, which he didn’t
            have the balls to say. “Guess who’s picture just got released, and is in Woodfield Mall;
            at Tuxedo Rose?”</p>
         <p>“Yours?” James asked, work the farthest thing from his mind.</p>
         <p>“No.” Caleb sighed again. “Yours.”</p>
         <p>Groaning, James laid back down, arm over his eyes, and tried to recall something about
            that shoot.</p>
         <p>“You’re sitting on a motorcycle, in a black tux,” Caleb offered a memory prompt. “I
            wanted to give you the heads up. There is no doubt it’s you in the picture. Face and
            tats.”</p>
         <p>“Oh yeah.” A visual of the classic Indian motorbike flashed through James’ head as he
            scanned his room. Cassie’s ripped blouse lay on the floor and his shoes were scattered
            by the bathroom door where he kicked them, anxious to continue with his debauchery.</p>
         <p>He touched her pillow and swallowed the lump in his throat. He needed to get out of his
            room before he smelt the damn pillow and did the second worst thing possible—call
            her.</p>
         <p>“Let’s go to the mall. I need new shoes and we can make fun of my picture.” He cast the
            blanket aside and jumped out of bed en route to the bathroom. The shiny acrylic tub sent
            a fresh shiver through him. He had to piss, clean up, and leave the vicinity. Fast.</p>
         <p>Caleb laughed. “You haven't checked your voice messages, have you?”</p>
         <p>“Christ, did you call me too? You’re worse than a chick. I slept in, okay?”</p>
         <p>“Funny, I hardly slept at all,” Caleb said, his voice full of irony. “I'm glad you got
            your beauty rest though. When the agency couldn’t reach you, they called me. Lorraine
            wanted to see if we were up for going to the mall… To hang out in front of the
            store.”</p>
         <p>James looked at his phone. Caleb must be slagging him.</p>
         <p>“James, did you hear me? It’s a paid gig.”</p>
         <p>“Seriously, Cal. Live, store models always look like douchebags.”</p>
         <p>Caleb huffed, “I don’t care. I need a diversion.”</p>
         <p>“You want to pick up?” James shoved his bathmat away with his foot. Tactile memories of
            last night were too painful with Caleb’s voice in his ear. “What’s wrong? I thought we
            talked this through.”</p>
         <p>“We did,” Caleb faltered, “You didn’t crash at the pool house. Did you go after
            her?”</p>
         <p>Goosebumps prickled James’ skin. “Can we discuss this later?”</p>
         <p>“Holy shit, you did.”</p>
         <p>The toilet shifted in and out of James’ focus. His hand jerked to the tank to steady
            himself, but he didn’t remember making it move, and couldn’t feel the cold porcelain
            under his fingers.</p>
         <p>“James. Are you still there?”</p>
         <p>How long had he been staring at the tank? “I'll do the mall thing if you want.”</p>
         <p>“Did you…” Caleb started, then stopped. “Want me to pick you up?”</p>
         <p>James stumbled to the sink. He cranked the cold water to full blast, counting on the icy
            temperature to sharpen his focus—and keep him on Earth.</p>
         <p>“James?” Caleb’s voice grew louder, “Do. You. Want. Me. To. Pick. You. Up?”</p>
         <p>“I’ll walk to your house.” Water splashed off James’ fingers and splattered the wall.
            “What if Cassie goes shopping today?”</p>
         <p>Caleb groaned. “Right now, I don't give a shit.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James lit a smoke and watched as Caleb snapped a photo of the section E6, parking sign,
            followed by one of the Charger. It was unusual, but he didn’t ask why, and Caleb didn’t
            volunteer the information; or say much of anything on the ride to Schaumburg.</p>
         <p>A short line of girls had formed in the mall’s corridor at the Tuxedo Rose entrance.
            James kept his eyes on the ground as he followed Caleb, into the store.</p>
         <p>A young woman leaned against the counter. “You’re five minutes late.” She thrust dress
            pants, white collared shirts and two pink bowties, at Caleb, then pointed to some basic,
            black oxfords. “Put these on. It’s all yours to keep.”</p>
         <p>“Sorry we’re late.” Caleb handed James his portion of the clothes. “Parking issues.”</p>
         <p>The girl’s attention shifted to James. She grinned.</p>
         <p>“What?” James said, wishing he had a joint to smoke.</p>
         <p>“I’m Beth, the event planner for the mall.” She extended her hand, her cheeks red. “I
            would have advertised the event differently had I realized I was getting the bag
            model.”</p>
         <p>Lost, James glanced at Caleb, but he appeared confused also.</p>
         <p>Beth disappeared behind the counter. She returned with a handled paper bag featuring a
            smaller version of the picture hanging in the store; and on the flip side, a closeup of
            James kissing a girl’s cheek.</p>
         <p>Caleb laughed, the first sincere sound out of him all day. “You look good, dude. I think
            your pay rate just went up.”</p>
         <p>“Shut up, Cal.” Heat prickled the back of James’ neck.</p>
         <p>Beth handed him the bag, “Can you autograph this please.”</p>
         <p>James scribbled his name, then glared at Caleb. “I'm on the bag. Isn't that
            brilliant?”</p>
         <p>Beth smiled at her bag. “Make sure you sign the release forms by the cash register. You
            have to hang out front for at least an hour to get paid. Are you two good?”</p>
         <p>“We’re good,” Caleb said as she walked away. Still chuckling, he turned to James.
            “Chill, dude. I didn’t know about the bag, or that it was an advertised event. Perhaps
            if you spoke to the agency instead of making me your go-between, you’d be better
            informed.”</p>
         <p>James headed to the change rooms. “You owe me. You know I hate being groped.”</p>
         <p>“Really?” Caleb said, from behind, “I could have sworn you were over your touch
            aversion. Besides, I think you owe me.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The chatter in the line of girls grew as they appeared outside the doors. James took his
            place. He did owe Cal, and Caleb didn’t know the half of it.</p>
         <p>After ten minutes, the situation grew tedious. James curbed the desire to be rude and
            answered question after question about his accent, his tattoos, and his relationship
            status; a question, he noted, they both answered as single. Caleb grinned and chatted. A
            girl even penned her number on his shirt sleeve.</p>
         <p>The last four years had been a steady array of girls; an endless sea of faces and asses,
            all the same. It held no appeal, anymore. He craved Cassie in a way that consumed him, a
            slow burn from the inside out, and it was obvious Caleb didn’t want her the same way. He
            couldn’t. Not after Red. Not the way he flirted with these girls. He may like Cassie,
            but he didn’t desire her.</p>
         <p>Somewhere near the end of the hour, the phone flashes blurred, and his body numbed. He
            focused on the voices around him so he didn’t stand there like part of the wall, but his
            cotton-stuffed head pounded, and he could no longer stop the switch to autopilot.</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>On the mezzanine, James leaned forward, his ribs against the hard edge of the food court
            table. All around him, tray carrying shoppers chatted, but their garbled voices bubbled
            in as if he were underwater.</p>
         <p>His extremities tingled, but he couldn’t worm himself back into concrete form—or</p>
         <p>get a clear memory of ending the swimsuit ordeal and walking to the restaurant.
            Sometimes it felt like half his life rippled in from another dimension.</p>
         <p>He pushed his plate of noodles away. “Does everywhere we go have to be so crowded?”</p>
         <p>“Eat.” Caleb pushed the plate back. “Jesus. Could you get any narrower?”</p>
         <p>Could he? He’d seen a picture of his real dad once. The man was tall and slim. Angular.
            “Bhi mo dhaid skinny.”</p>
         <p>“Your dad.” Caleb’s expression darkened. “Our dad is flying a plane right now—and he's
            not skinny.”</p>
         <p>But his real dad was skinny. Skinny, dark haired—and dead. The fork slipped from his
            grasp. In slow motion, he bent to get it. The food court tilted. Dizzy, he placed the
            fork on his plate and laid his palms flat on the table. “Have you talked to the C word
            yet?”</p>
         <p>Caleb shoved his plate away. “I don't want to talk about her. She’s doing a number on
            your head. Don’t try to pretend you’re not struggling through one of those damn
            episodes. You’re spaced the hell out.”</p>
         <p>“Whatever,” James said, “what are you going to do with those girls’ numbers?”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s expression frosted. He jerked his thumb toward his chest. “Perhaps I need an ego
            boost after last night’s discovery. I wish I could take a mental vacation like you. Just
            check out whenever I can’t deal with crap.”</p>
         <p>“Fuck you, Cal.” James jumped up. Dissociating wasn’t a vacation. It was disorienting
            and exhausting and used up a lot of mental energy to do the most mundane tasks. All
            facts Caleb was aware of.</p>
         <p>Caleb pinched the bridge of his nose. “Look. We can talk about the C word later. Forget
            about getting shoes, we have plans in half an hour and you need to get some air and
            touch the fucking cement or something.”</p>
         <p>“Plans?”</p>
         <p>“I spent last night on Craigslist.” Caleb gathered their dishes and chinned for James to
            follow. “Just remember before you go all moral cop on me and take Cassie’s side in this.
            I’m pretty much single right now.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James inhaled smoke from his cigarette. The burn in his lungs, the sun on his back, and
            the cool grass under his hands were all part of the real world.</p>
         <p>“You back from Neverland?” Caleb asked as he checked his phone. “We’ve got to roll, and
            I need you to be able to function.”</p>
         <p>“I’m a bit less spacey.” James ground out his smoke and flicked the butt at Cal. “Sorry,
            it’s not like I have a lot of control over it.”</p>
         <p>“What triggered that?”</p>
         <p>A shit load of reasons shut him down today, and he stared at the main one. Not that he
            could communicate that, or anything, to Caleb right now.</p>
         <p>“I don’t know, man.” Shrugging, he followed Caleb through the maze of cars. “Just
            stressed, I guess.”</p>
         <p>“Stress?” Caleb turned around. “This shit with Cassie has got to end.”</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>A pretty girl in a red tube top perched on the hood of the Charger. Her long black hair
            brushed the waistband of her painted-on blue jeans as she slid to the ground.</p>
         <p>Caleb gave the girl an awkward hug. “Hi, Candy. Told you my car would be easy to find.”
            He tossed the keys to James. “I’m in the back. You’re driving.”</p>
         <p>Too surprised to comment, James got in and started the engine. He locked eyes with Caleb
            in the rear-view mirror and raised both eyebrows. “Where to?”</p>
         <p>“Liquor Oasis.”</p>
         <p>James shifted into first. This was shaping up to be a long evening.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Half an hour later, James idled behind the beat-up liquor store. The owner jacked the
            price but sold them whatever they wanted. His only rule, Caleb did the buying since he
            looked older.</p>
         <p>Caleb rounded the corner, carrying a large paper bag. He resumed his position in the
            back and rustled out a six pack of Lime-A-Rita’s and a bottle of Jack Daniels, which he
            offered over the seat. “A sip won’t make you blow over.”</p>
         <p>James pushed the bottle away. “You sure you want to drink that? You and whiskey are
            never a clever idea.”</p>
         <p>“I know.” Caleb took a drink, then narrowed his eyes. “You got me tonight?”</p>
         <p>James nodded. “Do you have to ask?”</p>
         <p>“Do I?”</p>
         <p>The outing became clear. It wasn’t about the girl, the Jack, or even about Cassie. It
            was about proving allegiance.</p>
         <p>James met Caleb’s questioning gaze. “Ni Neaؘrt go cur le cheؘile,” he said, there is no
            strength without unity. A sentiment his stepfather fully believed in.</p>
         <p>Caleb smiled. “Drive around. I need to blow off steam.”</p>
         <p>With no direction in mind, James cranked the music and headed north toward the loop.
            After a while, driving in circles became tedious and the lack of dialogue made his lids
            heavy. Yawning, he headed north along Lake Shore Drive. It was getting late, but traffic
            continued to be thick. Something smacked the back of his head. He turned the music
            down.</p>
         <p>“Pull over. I have to piss.” It was the first audible thing Caleb said since they left
            the liquor store and his words slurred into each other. “Now,” he added when James
            didn't reply.</p>
         <p>Cursing under his breath, James turned left on the last exit into downtown. Finding
            somewhere to park, with a public bathroom, would be an impossible combination. </p>
         <p>Caleb hit the back of his seat again. “Come on, man.” He sounded like he was in
            pain.</p>
         <p>The girl laughed.</p>
         <p>“I'm looking. Don't get all bent at me because you’re about to piss your pants.” Out of
            desperation, he pulled into an underground parking lot.</p>
         <p>Caleb clambered over the seat and pawed the door handle. He spilled out, his shorts
            undone, and staggered to the front of the car.</p>
         <p>Groaning, James flicked the headlights off. He turned toward the back seat. Candy’s tube
            top encircled her stomach, the nipples of her breasts peeked through the strands of her
            hair. He reached for the bottle. She intercepted his hand and said something in broken
            English.</p>
         <p>He jerked his hand free. “I just want the Jack.”</p>
         <p>The bottle was half empty. There were four Lime-A-Rita's left and Candy appeared sober,
            which meant Caleb consumed a lot of whiskey.</p>
         <p>Caleb appeared at the door and stretched across the back seat. The girl wasted no time
            continuing where they left off.</p>
         <p>James swung around but couldn't help flicking his eyes to the mirror. The girl’s head
            dropped below his line of vision. By the sounds of things, she was busy. He twisted the
            keys to auxiliary and turned the music up.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A knock on the door jolted James awake. A huge security guard stared down at him. James
            pivoted around to check the back seat; Caleb was passed out and alone.</p>
         <p>The security guard tapped his ear and James turned the music down.</p>
         <p>“Sorry, sir,” he said, through the two inches of open window. “We're leaving now.” He
            put the charger in reverse and drove away before the man could reply.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James parked the Charger inside Caleb’s garage so Elizabeth wouldn’t see them. Neither
            would Cassie if she happened to look out her window. He got out and slid the front seat
            forward, as far as it could go. “We're home, Callie.”</p>
         <p>Caleb gripped the back of the seat and righted himself; head hanging, shirt wet, like he
            burped up nothing but alcohol. He looked up but his eyes remained unfocused.</p>
         <p>“Come on,” James pleaded, “try to walk. I have a harder time dragging your drunk arse
            around, than you have when you’re watching me.”</p>
         <p>Groaning, Caleb stumbled out the door. He pitched headfirst toward the cement.</p>
         <p>“Jaysus.” James grabbed Caleb’s arm. “I hate to see you like this.”</p>
         <p>“Like what? Like you; boy wonder,” Caleb muttered as James dragged him across the grass,
            “you can do anything you want, and it never fucking matters.”</p>
         <p>“Hush.” Ignoring the words, James focused on getting Caleb past the flat screen without
            knocking it over. “You’re as battered as I’ve ever seen you.” He dumped Caleb onto the
            sofa and clicked on the light.</p>
         <p>Caleb covered his eyes. “Turn it off. Too fucking bright.”</p>
         <p>“I Can’t. You’re a mess.” He pulled Caleb’s shirt off and emptied his pockets. After
            setting the puke bucket beside the sofa, he sunk onto the chair, lit a smoke, and pulled
            out his phone.</p>
         <p>There were a couple messages from Alexa, and three from Mary, who must be daft because
            he never replied to anything she sent.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s phone vibrated from the coffee table. James stared at it a few minutes, then
            reached for it. The thought he’d been reduced to sneaking peeks at Caleb’s messages made
            him cringe, but he turned it on, anyway.</p>
         <p>A password request came up. On a whim, he typed in Cassie’s name. The screen remained
            locked. Cheeks puffed, he entered, Mozart, the name of Caleb’s only dog. Cal was crazy
            about that dog, but Elizabeth decided the large black lab required too much effort and,
            a month after James came to live with them, Mozart disappeared.</p>
         <p>The screen lit up. There were ten texts from Cassie. Ten messages not meant for his
            eyes.</p>
         <p>His heart pounded in his ears as he made sense of Cassie’s words. She was sorry. She
            missed Caleb. She really liked him. James scanned the rest. They were similar in
            content, the recurring theme being, she wanted Caleb and only Caleb. The last one
            claimed, Sometimes James scares me.</p>
         <p>What did he expect? She dropped all sorts of hints, asking what his intentions were, and
            all he could offer was one night. Then he wigged out in front of her, and worse,
            confessed to being burnt by cigarettes. No wonder she left.</p>
         <p>He whipped Caleb’s phone against the wall; the shattering sound, proof Cal would never
            read those texts. He stripped to his underwear and wrapped a blanket around himself. His
            phone tucked in the cushion. Out of eyesight before he threw it too. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 39</h4>
         <p>A soft knock roused James from semi sleep. Still wrapped in the blanket, he stumbled to
            the door and inched it open, enough to peek out. Cassie stood on the other side.</p>
         <p>The three hours of shut eye he managed to get, hadn’t granted him enough brainpower to
            consider who might be knocking, and her wide eyes probably matched his. He jerked the
            door open and planted his feet in the middle of the threshold. “It’s seven o’clock.”</p>
         <p>Her cheeks pinkened. “I need to see Caleb.”</p>
         <p>“You don’t waste any time, do you?”</p>
         <p>Her blush turned crimson, but she raised her chin and pushed past him, leaving the faint
            scent of green apples to tease his senses.</p>
         <p>If he wasn’t fully awake, he was now.</p>
         <p>“It smells in here.” She knelt beside the sofa and leaned closer to Caleb.</p>
         <p>“Back off.” James plopped into the same chair he slept in. “Can’t you see he’s asleep?
            He’s had a hard night.”</p>
         <p>Cassie glanced toward the bucket of puke he’d been too tired to empty. “Is he sick?”</p>
         <p>“By his own hand,” James allowed. “I told you, he’s had a hard night. Which means my
            night also sucked. Not that you care.”</p>
         <p>Her gaze brushed over him. She chuckled. “You look like crap.”</p>
         <p>“And you find that funny?”</p>
         <p>“Leave it to you to make crap, appealing.”</p>
         <p>Not in the mood to be jacked around by her convoluted bullshit, he picked up his jeans.
            “I'm gonna go clean up; before I manage to scare you somehow. I’ll be in the bathroom if
            you want to talk.”</p>
         <p>He spent most of last night trying to read between the lines of her texts. Let her
            grapple with what was on his mind for a change. If there was any truth in the messages,
            she’d go home. If she cared, she would follow.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Halfway through his shower the door creaked open. He peeked around the curtain. Cassie’s
            back was to him as she eased the door into place.</p>
         <p>After a minute of painful silence, she asked, “what did you guys do last night?”</p>
         <p>He pulled back the shower curtain. She was on the closed toilet, elbows on her knees,
            Caleb’s broken phone in her hands.</p>
         <p>“Jeez, James, visual.” She dropped the phone onto the tank and shielded her eyes.</p>
         <p>Her reaction was hilarious. “It’s a little late to be prudish, don’t you think?”</p>
         <p>Cassie lowered her hands and looked right at him. “Maybe I don’t want to see you.”</p>
         <p>“Then why are you in my bathroom?”</p>
         <p>She shrugged. “Because maybe I want to see you.”</p>
         <p>He turned the water off and stepped onto the mat before reaching for a towel. He took
            his sweet time drying off, then wrapped the towel around his hips. Finally, he sat on
            the edge of the tub and examined her. “It's too early for feckin riddles.”</p>
         <p>“What happened to Caleb’s phone? Did he get any of my messages? Evidently, you got
            them.”</p>
         <p>“He got some, but not the last few.”</p>
         <p>“How can you be sure?”</p>
         <p>Despite himself, he chuckled. “I’m sure.”</p>
         <p>She widened her eyes, then narrowed them.</p>
         <p>“Stop it. I threw his effing phone. Happy?”</p>
         <p>“Threw it?” She sounded surprised. “Did you read all my messages?”</p>
         <p>What did she care what he read? She came over to make up with Caleb. And why shouldn’t
            she? He was her boyfriend. Not some messed up guy who only wanted to get laid.</p>
         <p>“Whatever,” she said when he didn’t answer. “How stupid of me to expect you to tell me
            anything.”</p>
         <p>He jerked to his feet; fists clenched. “I’ve been more honest with you than with anyone.
            Maybe I’m just not saying what you want to hear.” His doctor was right; girls would be
            the death of him.</p>
         <p>Cassie jumped from her seat, her face an angry shade of red. “What do you assume I want
            to hear?”</p>
         <p>“You want me to say, I want you.” She’d dropped enough hints. He stepped forward,
            backing her against the sink. “You want a relationship, something that involves
            emotions, not just sex, and you’re pissed ‘cause I won’t give it to you.”</p>
         <p>Her hands went to his chest, a weak attempt at pushing him back. “You can’t give it to
            me. You were right all along. It is all about sex with you. You’re not capable of
            anything else.”</p>
         <p> She threw his words back at him like tiny daggers, intending to inflict pain—and it
            worked.</p>
         <p>“Bugger off, Cassie,” he said, but his anger subsided into murky grayness. They were on
            the same side.</p>
         <p>He dropped the towel and reached for his jeans. “I’ve got to go out. Don’t you have
            school this morning, or some realm to vanish into?”</p>
         <p>“Today’s my last class.” She leaned against the sink and crossed her arms.</p>
         <p>“You can leave anytime,” he said when she didn’t move.</p>
         <p>She straightened, adding an inch to her height. “What’s the matter? Don't want to leave
            me here with Caleb?”</p>
         <p>He’d rather not. He lowered his head, close enough to inhale her amazing scent, and
            nestled his lips near her ear. “Admit it. You’re not scared of me. You’re scared of the
            way you feel about me.”</p>
         <p>Her paled complexion confirmed his accusation. Despite the texts she left, she still
            wanted him. Which was great because he could no longer deny, he clearly wanted her.</p>
         <p>“We’ll talk later, angel,” he said, “when you get back.”</p>
         <p>He needed time to figure out how he and Cassie could work, with the least amount of
            collateral damage. But it could work. He was capable of something else. And if something
            else was what she wanted; he would figure out a way to give it to her. </p>

      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 40</h4>
         <p>As soon as Allison dropped her off, Cassie headed to the pool house. The door was
            propped open, so she knocked as she entered.</p>
         <p>Caleb sat on the sofa, a bowl in his hand. He looked worse than this morning but smiled,
            giving her the courage to approach.</p>
         <p>“I’m airing the place out,” he said.</p>
         <p>The bucket was gone, but the gratuitous use of lemon cleaner did a poor job of
            concealing the smell of vomit. She wrinkled her nose.</p>
         <p>“It doesn’t smell as bad as it did.” Caleb set his bowl on the table next to a small,
            white box from the Apple store. “I drank too much last night and didn’t make it to the
            toilet. I was so sick I had to leave it for James to clean.”</p>
         <p>“That’s disgusting.” She eyed the closed bedroom door. “Is he here?”</p>
         <p>“Nope. He brought me a new phone, made me soup, then disappeared.” He patted the
            cushion. “It’s just as well. We need to talk about him.”</p>
         <p>She perched on the far end of the sofa. “New phone?”</p>
         <p>“Mine got broken last night. I am kind of in the dark as to how, though. Seems I’ve been
            in the dark about a lot of things lately.”</p>
         <p>Cassie winced. “Are you going to break up with me?”</p>
         <p>“Should I?”</p>
         <p>“I don’t want you to.”</p>
         <p>“Truthfully, I don’t want to either. I like how we can just hang out.” Caleb stretched
            for her hand. “But I need to know—is there something, anything, going on between you and
            James?”</p>
         <p>A million answers raced through her head, but none of them mattered. James didn’t want
            her. He couldn’t give her what she wanted. And even if he wanted to, more importantly,
            she couldn't give him what he needed.</p>
         <p>There was nothing going on between her and James. That was the truth.</p>
         <p>“The fact you’re taking this long to answer what should be a simple question is speaking
            volumes,” Caleb said after a minute.</p>
         <p>“There’s nothing going on,” she said, then looked at him. “I like you.”</p>
         <p>The answer produced a huff. “How much has James told you about himself?”</p>
         <p>She’d like to forget what he told her. It made her want to cry and hit someone at the
            same time. “He was burned by cigarettes. I got the impression he’d been tied up. He
            doesn’t like to be touched because of all the scars.”</p>
         <p>Caleb cleared his throat. “He doesn’t like to be touched because he can’t handle
            feelings of affection.”</p>
         <p>“He loves you.” That she knew for certain.</p>
         <p>“I’m different, Cassie.” Caleb faced her. “I want to tell you something and I need you
            to listen.”</p>
         <p>Unsure what to expect, she leaned back and drew her knees up.</p>
         <p>“I met James when we were six,” Caleb began. “We took part in a longitudinal study,
            examining children gifted in both music and math.”</p>
         <p>“You told me that.” It was one of the few bits of concrete information she got out of
            him.</p>
         <p>Caleb put his finger to his lips, motioning for her to be quiet. “We were stuck in these
            music classes, an enrichment program, three times a week for several years. Even though
            I only saw him in the evenings, he became my best friend.”</p>
         <p>She nodded, trying to anticipate where this was headed.</p>
         <p>Caleb looked away. “It never occurred to me to question why he wore long sleeves and
            pants all the time, even in the middle of summer. Or why he was never allowed to spend
            the night at my house, or why I wasn’t invited to his place. So many signs something was
            wrong. Then it was too late.”</p>
         <p>The words too late filled her with dread as the story’s trajectory began to make sense.
            This was about what happened to James.</p>
         <p>“We were in this old section of the University of Chicago.” Caleb looked sicker by the
            minute. “There was no air conditioning, and I complained all the time about the heat,
            but James never complained… about anything. I even refused to play one day because the
            room was stifling. But James did what the teacher said, always. He sat there and played,
            with or without me.</p>
         <p>“I was ten before I noticed how dirty and how tired he looked, how he smelled bad
            sometimes. Little kids don’t pick up on that stuff, right? I didn’t mean to be so
            self-absorbed in my perfect little world that...”</p>
         <p>His words choked up and he gave her a sideways glance. “Our teacher, Mr. Deadmen, always
            stood on my side of the piano. Guess he’d figured out hovering over James made him
            nervous. One day we had this substitute. She had flaming red hair and was all over us
            about proper hand placement and other piano crap. She positioned herself behind James,
            towering over him, and he stopped playing. Right in the middle of a song—he just
            stopped.</p>
         <p>“The teacher reached over his shoulder to show him where his hands should be or what bar
            we were on, assuming he was lost. I knew he wasn’t because he never made mistakes.</p>
         <p>“Anyway, she reached over, and he jumped up so fast I thought something bit him. I
            remember looking from her to James. The terror on his face struck me as funny and I
            laughed.</p>
         <p>“He gave me the dirtiest look and said, ‘What are you looking at, loser?’ before shoving
            me so hard I fell off the bench. He delivered one good punch before the teacher pulled
            him off. I had a black eye for a week. He didn’t get to laud it over me though, because
            he disappeared. I didn’t see him for two weeks, which was unusual. He never missed those
            classes.”</p>
         <p>Caleb stood up. “Do you mind if I smoke?”</p>
         <p>Mouth dry, she nodded her permission. Caleb went into the bedroom, then the bathroom. He
            returned to the sofa with a lit cigarette and plunked down beside her.</p>
         <p>“I’d overhear my parents. They also wondered what was going on with James. They’d talk
            to our teacher while we played, assuming we were occupied, but we were both listening. I
            began to catch on, something was wrong. Really, really, wrong. Then one day, during a
            Beethoven piece, James passed out. Slumped over on the keys.</p>
         <p>“Mr. Deadmen laid him on the floor, claiming it must be heat stroke because it was crazy
            hot in there that day. He went to make a call and get some water. I stayed put, James’
            head on my knees, talking to him. His eyes half-opened, but he didn’t respond. I
            assumed, you know being a kid and all, it might help to take his sweater off. So, I did.
            Then the shirt underneath.” Caleb’s face flushed.</p>
         <p>“Go on.” Cassie leaned forward.</p>
         <p>“James’ stomach was a road map of scars and scabs. His shoulders and chest were black
            and blue.” Caleb ground out his cigarette, snapping the butt in half. “Worse, his wrists
            were bandaged with gauze, but blood seeped through.</p>
         <p>He looked at her. “Cassie, he was skinny as a rail. I mean, you know James is tiny, but
            man, I’m talking concentration camp skinny. Makes me wonder how he actually got me on
            the floor to punch me, little shit that he was.”</p>
         <p>Affection was so obvious in Caleb’s voice it twisted her heart.</p>
         <p>Caleb sighed. “Mr. Deadmen came back, took one look at him, and left again. Shortly
            after, cops showed up, along with an ambulance. My mom came in and started crying. They
            tried to take him from me, but I wouldn’t let go. It was awful. The paramedics had to
            pry him out of my arms.</p>
         <p>“A week later he showed up at my house. I was so relieved because no one would tell me
            what was going on. My parents gave him the guest room, but he wouldn’t use it. I would
            wake up in the morning and he’d be asleep on my floor. He refused to talk to anyone but
            me, in fucking Irish, no less. I learned the damn language to understand what he
            wanted.”</p>
         <p>She stared at Caleb, trying to process the story.</p>
         <p>“Do you understand,” Caleb said, “James had been abused for a long time, all the while
            sitting beside me, and I didn’t catch on. I still think about those two weeks I didn’t
            see him. Even bleeding like he was, on that last day, his parents bandaged him up and
            sent him to class. Can you imagine how he looked when they didn’t send him? The hell he
            must have been living through.</p>
         <p>“I used to pester him about what happened during that time, but he’d never tell me. His
            shrink said to stop asking and let him disclose things on his own, when he was
            ready.”</p>
         <p>Cassie moved closer, her knees against Caleb’s thigh. She laid her palm against his
            cheek. “You were a child. You couldn’t have known.”</p>
         <p>He rolled his eyes, guilt all over his face. He’d believe he was to blame no matter what
            she said.</p>
         <p>“I learned from eavesdropping on my parents after one of the court appearances, that
            sick fucking stepfather of his, shackled him to the piano and forced him to practice.”
            He jerked away from her hand. “He’s never come right out and told me about the
            cigarettes. I can’t believe he told you.”</p>
         <p>She blinked back tears. They’d shared more than words, but it was the way James opened
            up, that captured her heart.</p>
         <p>“He must have tried to pull his wrists out of the cuffs, or something. They were so torn
            up he had to have skin grafts. He doesn’t remember that day, or half his childhood.”</p>
         <p>Caleb picked up her hand. “After his mother was released from prison, I took him to the
            halfway house to see her. I didn’t want to, but he insisted on telling her he sought
            emancipation. I thought the visit would help him remember stuff. Or maybe give him some
            sort of closure. I’m not sure what they said to each other, but she killed herself that
            night, and despite what she did to him… he cried for days.”</p>
         <p>“Why didn’t your parents adopt him?” Surely, they wanted to. Elizabeth loved James. It
            was obvious in all she did for him.</p>
         <p>Caleb humphed. “They tried, but things kept getting in the way. He lived with us for a
            few years, then got placed in foster care. The family also fosters a young girl.”</p>
         <p>“You know about Maury?”</p>
         <p>Caleb stiffened. “Only because my parents talk. James likes to keep his foster life
            separate from our life. Compartmentalized is the word his doctor used. Have you met
            her?”</p>
         <p>“No,” she lied. “James mentioned she brought cigarettes to the hospital.”</p>
         <p>Caleb nodded, seemingly satisfied with her answer. “Anyway, after his mother committed
            suicide, it turned out, not only was she crazy, but she was also loaded. James being her
            only child, inherited all her money. A nice twist of fate if you ask me.</p>
         <p>“I don’t know much about the money part. I got tired of trying to keep up with the legal
            stuff and focused on him. People get lost in the paper shuffle and I’ll never screw up
            so bad again, that James becomes a statistic.” He paused. “Of course, he would kill me
            if he found out I told you this.”</p>
         <p>“Why are you telling me?” </p>
         <p>“You need to know how screwed up he is.” Caleb laid his head against the cushion and
            gazed toward the ceiling. “Cassie, you are a no-win situation for him. Wanting you means
            hurting me and he can’t do that. Don’t make him choose between us. He will crack. Even
            if we break up, he would feel like he betrayed me. It would eat away at him. Do you
            understand? You’re only hurting him more.”</p>
         <p>“You’re worried for nothing. James doesn’t like me.”</p>
         <p>Caleb puckered his mouth, like he tasted something sour. “I asked him outright if
            anything was going on between you two.”</p>
         <p>“What did he say?”</p>
         <p>“It doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re in his head and he can’t handle you up
            there. Promise me you’ll stay away from him.”</p>
         <p>The ominous warning echoed in her head. Along with James’ confession, it made sense.
            "I’ll stay away,” she said. Goosebumps splattered her skin and she allowed Caleb to pull
            her closer. “I promise.”</p>
         <p>“Good. Because I like you. I like that we can talk. I never get to discuss James with
            anyone.” He kissed her forehead “I need more sleep. I’m so hung over, I took a Valium
            when I grabbed the smoke. Fucking James. Every time I go into his room, I find another
            random prescription bottle.” He reclined, bringing her with him. “Are we good?”</p>
         <p>“We’re fine.” The room spun around her. She closed her eyes. It was just past noon, but
            she was already exhausted.</p>

         <h4>Chapter 41</h4>
         <p>It was late afternoon when James returned. He crept around the TV and stood blinking at
            the sofa. Caleb lay asleep; Cassie tucked protectively under his arm. The scene made the
            conversation he practiced all day, pointless. Sighing, he dropped into the chair and lit
            a cigarette.</p>
         <p>Cassie’s shorts rode high on her thighs, her lips parted in sleep. He looked away and
            exhaled smoke. If she’d been by herself, he could have watched her forever. As it was,
            seeing her snuggled against Caleb gave him a headache. Or maybe heartache.</p>
         <p>So, this was jealousy—the desire to wake up your best friend by breaking his nose. He
            ground out his cigarette and cranked the volume on his earbuds. With one hand against
            his stomach, he let himself drift away.</p>
         <p>A thump on his knee jerked him awake. Cassie sat, arm stretched toward him, lips moving.
            He pulled his earbuds out.</p>
         <p>“I’m sorry,” she said in an exaggerated whisper, “I didn’t mean to startle you.”</p>
         <p>“You didn’t feckin startle me.” It came out ruder than intended. And louder. His eyes
            flicked to Cal.</p>
         <p>She pointed to the overflowed ashtray beside him. “How long have you been here?”</p>
         <p>The carnage of half-smoked cigarettes told a story he didn’t remember living—and didn’t
            care too. He shrugged.</p>
         <p>Bedhead suited her. Sexy swoops framed her face, the sun-bleached ends platinum. She
            stretched her legs out, long, tan and inviting. His memory may be jacked, but he would
            never forget the feel of those legs, wrapped around him on his bathroom floor.</p>
         <p>Their eyes met. She lifted her brows, then sucked her bottom lip.</p>
         <p>Groaning, he leaned forward. Perfect. They couldn’t be in the same room, without
            reliving what it felt like to be inside her. He motioned toward the sofa. “I see things
            have been mended in Cassie-land.”</p>
         <p>“Yeah. We’re good.” She smiled too broadly.</p>
         <p>“How’s he doing?”</p>
         <p>“Better. He said he needed sleep, so he took some pills from your room.”</p>
         <p>Shit. Caleb found his Valium. He’ll receive wrath for that later, but right now Cal’s
            breaths were steady, and he appeared peaceful. It would be a while before he woke.</p>
         <p>“Man, it's hotter than hell out today.” Standing, he yanked his shirt off and patted
            dry. He tossed it toward the growing pile of laundry, on his way to the bathroom.</p>
         <p>“Going swimming?” Cassie asked when he came out, wearing trunks, a towel around his
            neck.</p>
         <p>“No, shopping.” He waltzed past her but paused at the open door. “Don’t ask obvious
            questions to make conversation.”</p>
         <p>“My, aren’t you in a fantastic mood.”</p>
         <p>“If you want to discuss my mood, join me.” He closed the door behind him.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James opened his eyes underwater. With any luck, the sting of the chlorine would burn
            the image of Cassie and Cal snuggled together, off his retinas.</p>
         <p>Movement in the shallow end surprised him. He broke the surface and grinned. Cassie sat
            on the ledge, feet in the water, arms crossed. She’d changed into a bikini top but
            didn’t look happy.</p>
         <p>He swam toward her, thinking of an excuse for his current rudeness. His arm brushed her
            leg as he leaned his elbows on the pavers.</p>
         <p>“Sorry I was rude.” He smiled up at her, but she refused to meet his eyes. “I said I was
            sorry. Look at me.” He caught her chin, needing her to see him.</p>
         <p>She jerked out of his grasp. “Don’t touch me. I only came out here to tell you the other
            night was a mistake.”</p>
         <p>The words entered his brain, ricocheted, and exploded. A mistake. She’d still wanted him
            this morning, he couldn’t be too late. Water splashed as he tried to worm his way
            between her legs, to get closer.</p>
         <p>“Stop.” She pushed him away. “Caleb might be watching. We talked.”</p>
         <p>“What did you talk about? The weather? The Cubs?” Me. “Be more specific, Cassandra.”</p>
         <p>“About me and him.” She glanced toward the pool house. “What’s gotten into you? It's not
            like you give a crap.”</p>
         <p>Defeated, he let his arms fall limp to his sides, then laid his head in her lap and
            inhaled.</p>
         <p>“You’re getting my shorts wet,” she protested, but made no effort to remove him.
            Instead, she stroked his hair. “James. I don’t understand you. One minute you’re pushing
            me away, the next you’re like a little boy in need of my attention.”</p>
         <p>“I need more than attention.” He maneuvered between her knees and encircled her waist
            with his arms. This time she allowed it. She leaned into him, a missing piece to his
            convoluted puzzle.</p>
         <p>He buried his face against her chest. “I like the way you smell.”</p>
         <p>The confession made her chuckle.</p>
         <p>“Don’t laugh at me, angel.”</p>
         <p>“Sorry.” She inched back and looked down at him, a steady gaze that didn’t waver. “It’s
            just, so not what I expected you to say.”</p>
         <p>He could drown in the blueness of her eyes, and worse, wanted to. Her brows rose. Enough
            to tell him he was under examination—and exposing too much. Heat stung his neck, and he
            lowered his head. “What are you doing?”</p>
         <p>“If I can see your eyes, I can read your emotions.”</p>
         <p>He wanted to tell her, only Cal could read his mind, but when he looked up, his lips
            found hers instead. He placed a gentle kiss on them. Cassie gasped against his mouth.
            Her posture stiffened, but she didn’t pull back.</p>
         <p>“Read this,” he whispered, kissing harder.</p>
         <p>She emitted a tiny sound that hummed lyrically in his ears. He wanted to hear that sound
            again. He gripped her thighs and pulled her into the water, pressing her against the
            side of the pool.</p>
         <p>“And read this,” he said, pushing his hardness against her, loving the way she groaned
            into his mouth. So, what if Caleb saw them? He craved the feel of her body. She was his
            solace, and he wanted to go home.</p>
         <p>“Stop.” She shoved him back. “I can’t think straight. How do you always do this to
            me?”</p>
         <p>All the things he wanted to say jammed in his throat, leaving him sputtering. Sleeping
            with her was not a mistake. He wanted her. Enough to tell Caleb how he felt. They were
            brothers. They’d work this out.</p>
         <p>The rattling gate warned them their time alone had ended.</p>
         <p>She waved a finger at him. “Friends, James. It’s better for everyone this way.”</p>
         <p>He dove under the surface. Based on the way she kissed, it wasn’t better for either of
            them.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>By the time he broke the water in the deep end, Cassie climbed out, and Allison and
            Emily were poolside. Emily’s stare burrowed through him as he tread water.</p>
         <p>“W-What are you guys doing here?” Cassie wrapped a towel around her middle. Crimson
            highlighted her cheeks, bright enough to notice from the deep end.</p>
         <p>“Looking for you.” Allison’s frown reached him, across the ripples. “Where’s Caleb?”</p>
         <p>James swam to the shallow end and ascended the steps. “Cal’s sleeping,” he answered as
            Cassie fumbled for words.</p>
         <p>He stretched across a chaise and closed his eyes. Someone sat by his feet, most likely
            not Cassie. He gave himself a minute of delusional solitude before checking. Cassie and
            Allie were on their own chairs. Emily leered at him from the foot of his chaise. She
            held a Mickey of Tito’s.</p>
         <p>“I’ve been texting you all day.” Allison extended her phone as if Cassie asked for
            proof. “Don’t you ever check your messages? What’s going on over here?”</p>
         <p>“Nothing,” Cassie said, a little too fast. “I’m glad you guys came over. I’m so
            bored.”</p>
         <p>James sat upright and straddled the chair. “I’m bored too. I’ll go rouse, Cal. See you
            guys in a bit.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>As expected, Caleb was sleeping. James crept to the bathroom and turned the shower on.
            Ten minutes later, when he stepped out, Caleb had moved to a chair.</p>
         <p>“Have a good nap?” James asked, as he rummaged through the folded laundry that replaced
            the mound of dirty clothes he gathered earlier. “I heard you found my Valium.”</p>
         <p>Caleb got up slowly, then stretched. “I took one and flushed the rest.”</p>
         <p>That had been a full bottle of freshly acquired pills, and they weren’t easy to come by.
            But knowing better than to continue the conversation, James held up a pair of green
            swimming trunks. “Can I wear these? I think they’re yours.”</p>
         <p>Caleb shrugged so James stepped into them. “Cassie told me you two talked.”</p>
         <p>“We made up. It's all good.”</p>
         <p>The trunks hung off James’ hips. Eyes downward, he pulled the string tighter. “Cassie’s
            friends are here,” he said, after he secured the knot.</p>
         <p>Caleb shuffled into the kitchen. “I noticed. What do they want?”</p>
         <p>“I’m pretty sure I know what Emily wants, but that chick’s not worth the problem.” He
            frowned. “You’re moving pretty slow. Are you up for company?”</p>
         <p>“I don’t have to drink.” Caleb picked a piece of white paper off the kitchen table and
            scanned it. He plopped onto a bistro chair. “I’ll hang with Cassie and watch you
            self-destruct.”</p>
         <p>Self-destruction sounded great. Fortunately, Caleb missed the acid stashed in the back
            of the dresser. James scratched his chin. “How much damage can I possibly do to myself
            when Mom is in the house, eighty feet away?”</p>
         <p>“You’re in luck.” Caleb lifted the paper. “Mom's at a friend’s house for some sort of
            candle and wine party. She might spend the night. He crumpled the note and threw it at
            James. “The house is empty. Screw Emily on the dining room table if you want.”</p>
         <p>“I don't want to.” The note fell to the floor at James’ feet. “If it looks like that’s
            where my evening’s headed, stop me.” </p>

         <h4>Chapter 42</h4>
         <p>Cassie rolled onto her stomach, which made it physically impossible to watch James
            retreat into the house. Still heated from their kiss, she smiled against the cushion. I
            like the way you smell, he said.</p>
         <p>It didn’t feel like being with her, hurt him. In fact, the opposite seemed true. He
            appeared crushed at her rejection.</p>
         <p>“Did you and Caleb make up?” Allison stretched across the closest chaise. She shielded
            her eyes from the sun, but the slant of her mouth said she found something entertaining.
            “You’re in his backyard. You must have worked things out.”</p>
         <p>“So, that’s why you’re here?” Cassie raised the back of the chaise. “To get the latest
            gossip?”</p>
         <p>“Allie was worried about you. But that’s why I’m here.” Emily slid her shorts to her
            feet. Her pink, string bikini bottoms matched a skimpy top. She kicked the shorts aside.
            “Do you think James will like this?”</p>
         <p>Allison laughed. “He’ll like it alright. Enough to rip it off, then dump you flat.”</p>
         <p>“I want him to rip it off.” Emily glared at them both. “And please, spare me the
            lecture. I can handle James.” She stretched across the third chaise, facedown.</p>
         <p>Cassie bit her tongue; the pool house door swung open and Caleb headed toward them, his
            tight yellow swim trunks matching his sallow complexion. He sat a Bose speaker on the
            glass end table.</p>
         <p>“Yes, I’m still hungover.” Carefully, he lowered himself onto the pool’s edge, then
            placed his feet in the water. He motioned for Cassie to join him.</p>
         <p>“Must have been some party,” Allison said, “Why wasn’t I invited?”</p>
         <p>“I wasn’t either.” Cassie sat beside Caleb as he scanned Spotify. Beside Caleb, where
            she belonged. “What went on last night?”</p>
         <p>“I told you, I drank too much and checked out mid-evening. Hell, I even broke my phone
            and don’t remember.” Caleb chose a playlist labelled, mellow, and set his phone on the
            pavers. “You'll have to ask James—if he ever joins us.”</p>
         <p>On cue, James sauntered from the pool house. He tossed his Cubs ball cap aside and
            attempted the usual flip into the pool but lost his footing. His back slapped the
            water.</p>
         <p>Caleb flinched.</p>
         <p>James pulled himself out and shook off. The movement sent him staggering a few steps
            sideways. He shot Caleb a guilty look. “Aw, feck clean off, Callie. You told me I could
            get lit.”</p>
         <p>He picked up his hat and headed over, the waistband of his trunks low enough to expose
            half his skull tattoo.</p>
         <p>“I meant booze, dude.” Caleb sighed. “And I was joking about self-destructing.”</p>
         <p>The tiny triangles of Emily’s bikini strained to keep her large breasts from exposure as
            she jumped to her feet. “I almost forgot. We brought stuff to drink.” </p>
         <p>“James doesn’t need any,” Caleb said.</p>
         <p>“Sure, he does.” Emily headed to the gate. “It's in the car. Help me carry it,
            James.”</p>
         <p>James waited for the gate to slam before he followed. “Maybe I can get my dick sucked in
            the back seat,” he muttered as he passed them.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s arm slid from her shoulder. “Cuimhneamh ar do ghnó féin.”</p>
         <p>James stopped walking but didn’t turn around. “How come everything I do is your
            business, but nothing you do is mine?”</p>
         <p>The question received a groan from Caleb, though his posture stiffened.</p>
         <p>“That’s what I thought,” James said, as he continued to the garage.</p>
         <p>“Just so you know.” Allison sat on Cassie’s other side and splashed her feet into the
            water. “I don’t think even Emily would do that.”</p>
         <p>“Ignore him,” Caleb mumbled red-faced as his arm settled back around her. “He’s working
            through issues—and higher than a kite.”</p>
         <p>She didn’t need to be informed of James’ current state, she could tell for herself. Not
            just from James’ slightly off-kilter gait, but from Caleb’s unspoken language of heavy
            sighs and worried groans.</p>
         <p>“Really?” Allison wrinkled her nose, the nuances of James and Caleb’s friendship lost on
            her. “What did he take?”</p>
         <p>“Your guess is as good as mine.” Caleb squeezed Cassie tighter. “But if I pass out, or
            die from this fucking headache, please make sure he doesn’t drown in our pool.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>
         <p>James returned, carrying two half-filled bottles. A third bottle, bright blue in color,
            stuck out of the front of his trunks. Emily lugged an open box of beer, which she
            dropped at his feet. It looked like they raided someone’s liquor cabinet.</p>
         <p>“I know. The beer is heavier.” James grinned his shameless smile. “But she handed me
            these.”</p>
         <p>He set the bottles on the table, then pulled the one from his trunks. His waistband
            slipped lower, enough to see the entire skull. Allison coughed.</p>
         <p>After a brief survey, James unscrewed the bottle with the silver antlers. He took a
            drink and swallowed hard.</p>
         <p>Emily reached for the bottle. “Don’t drink all the whiskey.”</p>
         <p>“It’s mostly empty, and it’s Scotch.” James took another drink, this one longer. “Admit
            it, Em. You want me to drink. You figure if I’m all fecked up, I’ll do whatever you
            want.” He put the bottle to Emily’s lips. “There’s just a wee bit left.”</p>
         <p>Emily sputtered but drank. With an accomplished grin, she set the empty bottle down.</p>
         <p>“Em thinks if she drinks James will like her more,” Allison said low enough for only the
            three of them to hear.</p>
         <p>“Tell her not to waste her time.” Caleb didn’t bother to hide the disgust in his voice.
            “A lot of girls have tried that same thing—and failed.”</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p/>
         <p>No matter how she sat, next to Caleb on the cushioned swing, Cassie could see the entire
            pool, including Emily and James foreplay in the water. At one point, she was sure James’
            suit was off. She should have left when Allison bailed.</p>
         <p>With James’ help, Emily fumbled out of the deep end. She staggered to the swing and
            wrapped her arms about herself. “Let’s make a fire,” she slurred.</p>
         <p>“Nope,” Caleb answered quick, “it’s not cold enough.”</p>
         <p>“It’s the ambience,” Emily insisted, “It’s pretty at night. We can do marshmallows.”</p>
         <p>James came up behind and draped both arms over Emily’s shoulders, steadying her slight
            sway. “Mom has marshmallows in the house, Cal. If you get them, I’ll start the
            fire.”</p>
         <p>Caleb scowled. “My head’s pounding.” Then, surprising Cassie, he got up and headed to
            the house.</p>
         <p>Emily turned around and grabbed James’ neck. She strained upward to get her lips on his,
            but he dislodged her grip and led her to the firepit.</p>
         <p>“Wait here,” he said as he sat her on one of the Adirondack chairs. “Don’t move.”</p>
         <p>He disappeared into the pool house. He returned with folded newspaper, then stopped to
            pick up one of the tiny piles of neatly cut wood, stacked along the fence.</p>
         <p>He didn't strike Cassie as an outdoorsy type. She walked over to investigate.</p>
         <p>“She’s out.” James chinned to Emily asleep on the chair. He pulled scissors from the
            pocket of his trunks and cut the zip tie securing the wood.</p>
         <p>Cassie raised her brows. “Do you know what you’re doing?”</p>
         <p>“With the fire or Emily?”</p>
         <p>It was obvious he knew what he was doing with Emily. She dropped onto the opposite
            Adirondack and glared at him. “With the fire, asshole.”</p>
         <p>“You didn’t think I was an asshole, earlier.” He arranged the logs over the paper then
            pulled matches and a small container of lighter fluid from his other pocket.</p>
         <p>Caleb returned to a cloud of black smoke. He rolled his eyes at Emily, then tossed a bag
            of marshmallows at James—followed by a metal skewer, which he threw at James like a
            dart.</p>
         <p>“I just took one of mom’s sumatriptan.” Caleb extended his hand. “Come on Cassie. Let’s
            go back to the swing. This smoke will kill me.”</p>
         <p>Cassie glanced at James. She couldn’t be with him, but didn't want animosity between
            them, either.</p>
         <p>“I want a marshmallow,” she said. “I’ll be right over.”</p>
         <p>“Give it a few minutes, Cal.” James poked the fire. “The smoke will clear, and I’ll give
            your girl what she wants.”</p>
         <p>“She wants a marshmallow,” Caleb called over his shoulder, “grow up.”</p>
         <p>James threaded a few marshmallows on the skewer. When they turned golden, he pointed
            them at her. She took two.</p>
         <p>“Emily,” he called out as he waved the skewer. “Wakey, wakey. Want a marshmallow?” He
            plopped the remaining one in his mouth. “Guess not.”</p>
         <p>He ate a couple more without toasting them, then lit a cigarette. He leaned back in the
            chair and exhaled a smoke ring.</p>
         <p>“I want another marshmallow.” Cassie tapped his arm with a stick. When that didn’t work,
            she used it to lift the brim of his hat.</p>
         <p>“Stop.” He grabbed the stick and threw it towards the fire. “Don’t tell me you want to
            be friends, then come onto me. Christ, I’m supposed to be the fucked-up one.”</p>
         <p>She slid back in the chair. “Did it occur to you I might actually want a
            marshmallow?”</p>
         <p>“It's clear what you want is my attention.” He huffed. “Don’t think Cal isn’t over there
            wondering what the hell is up.”</p>
         <p>She peered across the grass but couldn’t make out Caleb’s features in the darkness.
            “Caleb isn’t paying attention.”</p>
         <p>“Well, I am. I’m done, angel. Keep pushing me and I’ll be bad.”</p>
         <p>“Bad? How?”</p>
         <p>“I’ll kiss you, right here. A public declaration. That's what you’ve been wanting from
            me. What changed?” James removed his hat. His hair lay plastered to his forehead, his
            pupils, endless black holes. “Jaysus, Cassie.” His voice lost its edge. “What do you
            want from me?”</p>
         <p>“It doesn’t matter what I want. You’re not supposed to be in a relationship. It could
            make…you know, make your condition worse.” She told Caleb she wouldn’t tell James what
            she knew, but if they were all on the same page, things might be less confusing.</p>
         <p>“My condition?” He tossed the skewer to the ground. “Fuck!”</p>
         <p>If Caleb was awake, he heard that. Emily jerked upright. She scrubbed her eyes.</p>
         <p>James stared toward the swing for a few seconds, then glowered at Cassie. “Define my
            condition.”</p>
         <p>“What happened with your parents....” She faltered when his mouth fell open. “You know
            what I mean.”</p>
         <p>He brought his hands to his thighs, his fingers balled into fists. “Why does everybody
            around me insist they know what’s best? You’re not in my head. And neither is Cal.”</p>
         <p>Emily wobbled to her feet, teetering too close to the flames. “I want to go home.”</p>
         <p>“Christ.” James tossed his cigarette into the flames then grabbed Emily’s arm. “It’s
            okay, Em. You can sleep in the pool house.”</p>
         <p> He cast a poisonous glare at Cassie. “Your logic is feckin flawed and what you’re doing
            isn’t fair to Cal. Besides, go ahead. See if you can ignore me.” </p>

         <h4>Chapter 43</h4>
         <p>James returned five minutes later with a blanket from the pool house. He spread it
            across Caleb, grabbed the vodka and headed toward Cassie, still by the fire.</p>
         <p>“Cal’s out.” He took a drink.</p>
         <p>“Stop,” she said, “Why do you have to drink so much?”</p>
         <p>“I’m not that drunk, and ha. I forgot about your, ‘I can’t drink or do drugs if I want
            to hang with you’, Rule.” He set the bottle down. “I want to hang with you.”</p>
         <p> He crossed the grass to the leafy coverage of the pergola. The long vines, after such a
            hot summer, hung almost to the ground. After a minute, she followed.</p>
         <p>As he predicted. She couldn’t resist him.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James lounged against the thick corner post of the pergola. He spread his arms wide.
            “Isn’t this where the whole mess began? In Caleb’s backyard?</p>
         <p>“It is,” she allowed, “but you weren’t high that night.”</p>
         <p>“Some drugs help you understand what you want.” He caught her gaze. “I know what I
            want.”</p>
         <p>Responding to his honesty was an art she never mastered. With an embarrassed giggle, she
            stepped back. From his frown, he wasn’t thrilled with her reaction.</p>
         <p>Fisting the bottom of her shirt, he tugged her closer. “Friends aren’t supposed to laugh
            at each other.”</p>
         <p>His lips graced her neck, tasting before sucking. Her shoulders relaxed. She tilted her
            head, allowing his mouth to skip across her collarbone. “Friends aren't supposed to
            kiss,” she managed.</p>
         <p>All night long she felt dead, but now she was alive. Even the air seemed different.
            Charged. She closed her eyes. Her body tingled and her breathing deepened, but she
            didn’t touch him. As usual, James was right. She was being unfair to Caleb. He was her
            stand-in. The guy she wanted, who stoked her pulse, stood in front of her.
            Untouchable.</p>
         <p>“Come with me.” Still holding her shirt, James stepped toward the house.</p>
         <p>“I can’t.” God, she would let him lead her straight into traffic if she wasn’t
            careful.</p>
         <p>He released her and surrendered. “I get it. Friends. No more lips on you. I want to show
            you something.”</p>
         <p>“And it’s not your penis?”</p>
         <p>He laughed, a sound she could drown in. “It’s not my penis. I swear it.”</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>“Do you know where you are?” James leaned against the bedroom door, blinking under the
            brightness of the ceiling light.</p>
         <p>She had never been in the room at the end of their hall, but the big Irish flag
            dominating one wall offered a clue.</p>
         <p>“Your bedroom?” She looked around for added conformation.</p>
         <p>Unlike his apartment, evidence of his past lay scattered. Framed photos looked homeless,
            leaning against each other or upside down. Stacks of books teetered like an unruly game
            of Jenga. Trophies and ribbons littered the dresser top, all covered with an inch of
            dust.</p>
         <p>Someone ate his entire childhood and threw it up in this room, never to touch it
            again.</p>
         <p>James’ gaze lingered at the window. He rubbed his arm, where the snake tattoo resided.
            “It is my room,” he said, “but I’ve never spent the night in it.”</p>
         <p>“You used to sleep on Caleb’s floor.”</p>
         <p>He jerked his attention to her. “Who told you that?”</p>
         <p>“Caleb did,” she admitted. “It's okay, James, everyone has problems sleeping from time
            to time.”</p>
         <p>He sat on the edge of the bed and sighed. “Come over here.”</p>
         <p>She crept over, till her feet were between his, and her shins pressed the mattress.
            Wanting to comfort him, she allowed him to lay his head against her stomach.</p>
         <p>“Are you okay?” she asked, her hands in his hair. She squatted to get a look at his
            face. His pupils were still large.</p>
         <p>He scooted backward, toward the headboard and motioned for her to join him. “Teacht
            anseo.”</p>
         <p>She wanted nothing more than to crawl beside him and chase away his pain, but his
            bottoms rode dangerously low and her conscience cartwheeled.</p>
         <p>“Please.” He lay flat and brought his arm over his eyes. “I want to spend the night in
            here. I’d have taken you to my place if I wanted sex.”</p>
         <p>The misery in his voice cracked her resolve. Caleb was wrong; she would hurt James if
            she left. Besides, they were only sleeping. She turned the light off, then crawled
            across the bed to lie next to him. “What if Caleb searches for you?”</p>
         <p>“This is the last place he’d look.”</p>
         <p>His breathing evened out. It didn’t take long for her to drift off beside him.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>***</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James opened his eyes to the tricolor; the Irish flag and smiled. He did it; spent the
            night in his room. But he didn’t have time to enjoy the victory. The door opened.
            Elizabeth stood in the hallway, a large box in her arms.</p>
         <p>“James. You’re in here?” She stepped into the room and shut the door. “With a girl?”</p>
         <p>Cassie. She lay curled beside him. A chill shot down his spine.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth placed the box on the floor and crossed the room. “What are you doing in
            here?”</p>
         <p>“Sleeping,” he said as the tingle in his spine spread to his extremities, “God’s
            truth.”</p>
         <p>Cassie rolled onto her back, her eyes sleepy, until they drifted toward Elizabeth. Then
            they opened wide. Gasping, she scooted to the far side of the bed.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth also gasped. Her gaze locked on him. “Go home, Cassie,” she said, but her
            mouth lacked synchronicity with her words. “I need to talk to James. Alone.”</p>
         <p>“Look at her,” James demanded. He pulled the blanket from Cassie’s grasp. “She's fully
            dressed. We didn’t do anything.”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth covered her eyes. “Pull up your shorts.”</p>
         <p>He jerked the trunks up and shook out his arms. His hands tingled. He must have made a
            noise because both Cassie and Elizabeth stared at him.</p>
         <p>“Are you okay?” The anger in Elizabeth’s face, softened. She was good at telling when he
            lost it, almost as good as Caleb. But Cassie remained clueless—and he wanted her to stay
            that way.</p>
         <p>He bumped Cassie’s shoulder with his. “Go home. I’ll take care of this.”</p>
         <p>Cassie paused then, head down, scampered past Elizabeth, out the door.</p>
         <p>“I told you. I didn’t touch her.” Caleb would kill him when he found this out.</p>
         <p>“But it’s okay for you to be half-naked in front of her?”</p>
         <p>This was going nowhere, fast. James floated to his feet and steadied himself against the
            solid wooden headboard. “Cassie’s not at fault. If you’re going to be mad at someone,
            hate me.”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth reached for him. “Why don’t you sit down for a bit?”</p>
         <p>He lurched back. “Don’t touch me.” He didn't plan to sit anywhere, not with Elizabeth.
            Not with anyone.</p>
         <p>She lowered her arm. “James. Breathe in, breathe out. Slow, steady breaths.”</p>
         <p>Fuck her and her grounding techniques. He didn't need a mother. Not his mother, not
            Caleb’s.</p>
         <p>But he needed Cal.</p>
         <p>He pressed his back flat against the wall. “Where’s my brother?”</p>
         <p>“In his room, sleeping.”</p>
         <p>“Are you going to tell him?”</p>
         <p>Elizabeth sunk onto the bedside. “I won’t. But Caleb can read you well. Even when things
            aren’t so obvious. You should be honest with him. Be honest with yourself.”</p>
         <p>He tried honesty with Cassie. It got him nowhere. “Am I dismissed?”</p>
         <p>“Let me make you some tea. James, please. We can talk.”</p>
         <p>He dodged for the door, before he confessed how badly he wanted Cassie, or collapsed
            into Elizabeth’s arms, longing for his own mother. The dead one, he didn't want.</p>
         <p>What he needed, was to get obliterated. Before his head exploded. </p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 44</h4>
         <p>Cassie spent the day in her room, too nauseated to eat. By evening, when she hadn’t
            received the barrage of angry messages she’d expected from Caleb, she calmed down. For
            whatever reason, Elizabeth hadn’t told him.</p>
         <p>Someone knocked on her door. She kicked through the crumpled piles of journal paper, all
            filled with half written poetry, and headed downstairs. Caleb waited on the front steps.
            His fistful of pink phlox confirmed his ignorance. </p>
         <p>“I’m sorry I fell asleep on you last night.” He held the flowers out. “I was so
            hungover.”</p>
         <p>“Thanks.” Guilt churned her stomach as she took the phlox. Sleeping beside James was the
            antithesis of leaving him alone. But Caleb didn’t witness how sad James looked, standing
            in his bedroom.</p>
         <p>Caleb followed into the kitchen and fidgeted behind her as she retrieved a vase from
            under the sink. After stuffing it with the flowers, she faced him. “Ah…”</p>
         <p>“Don’t,” he said, finger against her lips. “Let me make yesterday up to you. Starting
            with this.” He snaked his arms around her and pulled her closer so he could reach her
            lips.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He smelt like Caleb and tasted like Caleb. Neither of which were unpleasant. His lips
            were smooth; his tongue not disgusting, but foreign. She kissed back, wanting to feel
            something, but James had been right. It didn’t work that way. Not when her heart had
            wandered.</p>
         <p>Caleb pulled back, hurt evident. “What’s the matter?”</p>
         <p>“I didn’t sleep well last night,” she lied. Her heart may be residing somewhere in the
            twilight zone, but her brain needed to get into gear. If she broke up with Caleb, she’d
            be alone. James wouldn’t be there for her. Caleb made that clear.</p>
         <p>“I’m tired too.” He nodded earnestly. “Come to the pool house. James isn’t there. We can
            chill.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>They settled in front of the TV. Caleb’s lips and hands roamed her body, a restless
            exercise, she tried to enjoy. Eventually, they moved to the bedroom. But she couldn’t
            let him inside her. Not in a bed rumpled by James, his leather jacket hanging from the
            back of the chair, his sunglasses watching from the bedside table.</p>
         <p>Still on half-speed, Caleb was good about her refusal. In the end, the sun went down,
            and they fell asleep next to each other.</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>Cassie's phone chirped. She reached over the edge of the bed and pulled her it from her
            shorts. </p>
         <p>Hey. Was all the text said.</p>
         <p>The number was nameless, and six in the morning was too early to be awake. Her phone
            sounded again. She fumbled with the volume before reading it.</p>
         <p>Meet me at Saint Ambrose in fifteen mins. I NEED to see you.</p>
         <p>Saint Ambrose; the church down the street from James. Leaning slightly, she checked
            Caleb. His eyes were shut, and he snored lightly.</p>
         <p>Who is this? she replied.</p>
         <p>A minute ticked by.</p>
         <p>James.</p>
         <p>The messages were coherent; even punctuated. He seemed sober, and he needed her. The
            phone beeped again.</p>
         <p>PLEASE</p>
         <p>Okay. She pressed send, before she could change her mind.</p>
         <p>She pulled on her shorts and tee and headed for the door. The bed creaked. Pausing, she
            waited for Caleb to call out to her, but the air conditioner remained the only
            sound.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James waited on the hood of his car. He appeared fine. “I wasn’t sure you’d show.”</p>
         <p>“You said you needed me.”</p>
         <p>“I do need you. I’m bored.” He sunk behind the wheel and she settled into the passenger
            seat. He paused before turning the engine over. “I also want to apologize for getting
            you caught in my bed. Elizabeth said she wouldn’t mention it and I believe her.”</p>
         <p>“You promised nobody would go in that room,” she said, though she wasn’t mad at him.
            What happened had been her fault as much as it was his.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>They headed north, cutting through the city instead of getting on the freeway. His Nike
            sport shorts, and crisp white polo were unusual attire.</p>
         <p>“Where are we going?” Her words seemed to wake him up.</p>
         <p>He turned onto Lakeshore drive. “You’ll see.”</p>
         <p>“So…” he glanced at her, “what did you end up doing yesterday?”</p>
         <p>“Not much.” She couldn’t tell James where she’d spent last night, no more than she could
            tell Caleb where she’d slept the night before. It was official, she’d entered nowhere
            land. Purgatory.</p>
         <p>She nudged his hand, resting on the shifter. “What did you do?”</p>
         <p>“I got drunk, then laid. In that order.” He tossed her a glance. “I won’t lie about
            it.”</p>
         <p>She snatched her hand back. “Is that why you needed to see me? To tell me?”</p>
         <p>“No. But I’m being honest. It meant fuck all, Cassie.”</p>
         <p>She could relate. Last night’s make out session with Caleb, meant nothing. No matter how
            hard she tried, she couldn’t resurrect her desire. It vanished, or maybe it never
            existed.</p>
         <p>They were no longer on Lakeshore Drive, and somewhere above the city. Ritzy shops lined
            the streets along with upscale eateries. James turned into a smooth parking lot.</p>
         <p>“We’re here,” he said, pulling into a spot that overlooked the green expanse of a golf
            course.</p>
         <p>Here turned out to be a roaming mid-century building, housing a country club. James dug
            two short-handled racquets from the trunk and gave her one.</p>
         <p>“You want to play racquetball?” she asked, holding the racquet at arm’s length.</p>
         <p>“I want to spend friend time with you. Sober time. Me and you. Understand?”</p>
         <p>She got it. She was worth his effort to remain sober; his way of saying she meant
            something to him.</p>
         <p>“Walk, luv,” he said from up ahead. “I promise I won’t do anything unfriendly to you. At
            least not on the court.”</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Racquetball translated into an acceptable way for him to spend the morning with his arms
            wrapped around her. He demonstrated the high lob serve, the drive Z serve, and the
            correct way to pivot to increase her stroke strength.</p>
         <p>Exhausted, she plopped down cross-legged on the edge of the mat. “I think this has been
            your excuse to grope me, but I’ll give you points for creativity.” She casually reached
            for his phone. The last message he received had been from Emily.</p>
         <p>“You don’t have to search my phone. I’ll tell you anything you want to know.” He tossed
            the green ball into the air and caught it, before whacking it against the wall.</p>
         <p>She set the device down. Watching James was more fun than snooping, especially when
            snooping held the potential to burn.</p>
         <p>After another round, he dropped beside her and mopped the wet hair from his face. He
            stared across the few feet that separated them.</p>
         <p>“This is bullshit,” he said after a moment. “Let’s go home.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Despite the lack of communication in the car, it didn’t take long for her to figure out
            home meant his place. He snugged the Mustang against the house and cut the engine. “Are
            you okay to be here?”</p>
         <p>“I have no other plans.”</p>
         <p>“You know what I mean.” He gave her a pointed look. “Caleb must be awake by now.”</p>
         <p>“I’m good,” she said.</p>
         <p>She had time. She would make time. Same thing.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>She waited on James’ unmade bed while he went into the bathroom. The faucet turned on. A
            few seconds later, he appeared shirtless in the doorway.</p>
         <p>“I’m gonna clean up.” He stepped out of his shorts and grinned before disappearing
            around the corner.</p>
         <p>The lure was too strong, she was too weak, or the fates too determined. She got off the
            bed and walked into the bathroom.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>James maintained his silence when she entered, even as she removed her clothing and
            climbed into the opposite end of the tub. He finished soaping, then submerged, leaving
            his hair to float on the ripples. When he rose, he closed his eyes and stretched his
            legs beside her, ankles resting on the tubs edge.</p>
         <p>Now that she knew about the abuse, she no longer saw tattoos, just carnage. She kissed
            her fingers and touched his shin. “You’re quiet,” she said.</p>
         <p>“Thinking.”</p>
         <p>“About what?”</p>
         <p>“You’re in my tub. We must be close friends.”</p>
         <p>A hot flush burnt through her, and the heat of the water didn’t help. She rose to sit on
            the rim.</p>
         <p>“Is it too hot?” He splashed his feet into the water and leaned forward. “I can add some
            cold. I tend to like my water too hot for anyone else.”</p>
         <p>Anyone else? Did he bring the girl he slept with here? Emily? She reached for a towel,
            but he intercepted her hand. “Don't cover up. You’re beautiful. I love the way your hair
            twists and how pink your cheeks are.”</p>
         <p>He kissed her knee, then placed a few slow kisses upward, along her inner thigh.</p>
         <p>She brought her hands between her legs. “What are you doing?”</p>
         <p>“Renegotiating our friend arrangement.” He flicked the inside of her leg with his
            tongue. “Consider this a rebellion.”</p>
         <p>“Stop it.” Even the idea of his intentions made her want to lock her ankles
            together.</p>
         <p>He rested his chin against her knee and smiled his most charming smile, the one she knew
            got him what he wanted, and trailed a finger down her calf. “Let me taste you. I’m not
            used to begging, but I’m sure I can be quite convincing.”</p>
         <p>She didn’t want him begging. Did she?</p>
         <p>His eyes darkened. He rose to his knees, his face inches from hers. “I gave you five
            minutes to examine me. I’m asking for half that time.”</p>
         <p>He didn’t seem to care that he was on full display, and she never wanted anyone so bad.
            What did that say about her? Her mother would have a word for it.</p>
         <p>“I'm new to this,” she said. “It's scary.”</p>
         <p>“I was new to that. Lips on me… there. Don’t think I wasn’t scared.”</p>
         <p>“Are you new to this?” She had to ask.</p>
         <p>He pressed his forehead against hers then inched back. “There's that jealous streak. No.
            I'm not new to this, in fact, I'm quite good at it.”</p>
         <p>How many girls had he done this to? A vision of his head between someone else’s legs
            made her want to cry. Especially if that someone had been Emily.</p>
         <p>“You shouldn’t ask questions you don’t want answers to.” He removed her hands from
            between her legs and placed them on the rim, then sunk into the water, his breath steamy
            on her inner thigh. “Relax, Angel.”</p>
         <p>Relax? While he was there? Impossible. She splayed her fingers across the tub’s smooth
            acrylic surface in search of security. Then his hand knotted around hers, and heat
            filled her insides.</p>
         <p>After a minute, she didn’t have to try to relax. She peeked between her lashes, the
            visual as much of a turn on as the feeling. She shut her eyes and gave in to the
            sensations.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>When she opened her eyes, James reclined against his end of the tub. A smug grin spread
            across his face.</p>
         <p>She slid into the water. “You look pretty impressed with yourself. Like you said, you've
            had lots of practice.”</p>
         <p>His smile faded. He closed the gap between them, drawing her between his knees. “From
            the first time I saw you, I couldn’t get you out of my head. Only you have been here,”
            he motioned around the room, then placed her hand over his heart, “and only you have
            been here. That counts for something, right?”</p>
         <p>His eyes sparkled, sincere and warm. He brought her hand to his lips and sucked on her
            fingertips. When he got to her pinky, his eyes met hers.</p>
         <p>“What I don't get is you never seem concerned about Cal's past, or even his present, for
            that matter. But you’re all over me. It bugs the shit out of you when I’m with other
            girls.” His expression grew serious. “It's not just the physical stuff that freaks you
            out, though. You're possessive of my head. I can feel you trying to get in. You want to
            know everything about me.”</p>
         <p>She wasn’t jealous of Caleb. Spurned maybe, but not get your hands off my man, jealous.
            She’d even let the Amber thing slide. She’d been more hurt Caleb lied to her than insane
            he was with another girl. But she wanted to know James inside and out.</p>
         <p>Her eyes filled with tears. Did he always have to be so correct?</p>
         <p>“Hey.” His expression fell. “It's okay. You're welcome to my head, but it's sort of
            messed up in there.”</p>
         <p>She backed away. “I have no rights to you. I don't know why I'm so possessive.”</p>
         <p>Water splashed as he pulled her closer, so her head rested against his chest. He
            tightened his legs around her. “We don't have to analyze our arrangement right now.”</p>
         <p>But they weren’t allowed an arrangement. Caleb said being with her would kill James.
            Despite the heat, she shivered.</p>
         <p>“Christ, Cassie. The water’s plenty hot and you're shivering.”</p>
         <p>She gave him a tiny shove. “I’m not cold. In fact, I need to cool down. You need to cool
            down.”</p>
         <p>“I’m past cooling down.”</p>
         <p>His sultry tone made his intentions clear and goosebumps rose across her skin. “Why are
            we always in water?”</p>
         <p>“That's an easy fix.” He stepped out of the tub. “Come here.”</p>
         <p>She rose gradually and stood beside him. To her surprise, he scooped her up. “James,”
            she protested, but he carried her the short distance and laid her on the bed.</p>
         <p>“Open your eyes, angel.” He kissed the tip of her nose. “We’re officially out of the
            bathroom.”</p>
         <p>“And getting your sheets wet.”</p>
         <p>“I have a dryer.” He kissed her collarbone, sucking in her skin—soft—then harder.</p>
         <p>She pushed his head away. “Don’t give me a hickey.”</p>
         <p>“Don't worry,” he said after a few seconds, voice cooler. “I understand the drill.” He
            continued kissing her, moving to her breasts. He latched down on one, hard.</p>
         <p>“Damn.” Not expecting teeth, she jumped.</p>
         <p>He caught her hand and kept it. Something changed in him, but she allowed him to settle
            between her legs and bucked her hips to meet his, craving to close the distance between
            them.</p>
         <p>“Patience, Cassandra.” He laced his fingers through hers.</p>
         <p>He was taking his time, too much time, and he’d called her Cassandra. Still, she wiggled
            under him, not wanting another second to go by without feeling him inside her. He
            pressed his face to hers, his breath hot, and gave her what she wanted.</p>
         <p>The heat of his body spiraled her into a void where it didn’t matter if she hurt him,
            hurt Caleb, or hurt herself. She wrapped her legs around him, not wanting to let go.</p>
         <p>Something warm dripped onto her cheeks. She inched back and opened her eyes. Tears
            clumped his lashes together.</p>
         <p>“I think I’m in love with you,” he said, his own eyes shut. Another tear dropped on her
            cheek before he buried his head in her shoulder.</p>
         <p>She tightened her free arm around him, wanting to say she might love him too, but he
            hushed her with his lips and rocked against her, squeezing her fingers so hard they
            hurt. Until he stopped moving and tried to back out</p>
         <p>“Don’t go.” She held him tighter. “Please.”</p>
         <p>That bit of ownership, no matter how false, was worth anything. He must have wanted it
            too because he stopped fighting and relaxed, filling her with tiny pulsing sensations.
            She collapsed under him, blinking away her own tears.</p>
         <p>She had been with two different people, and both made her cry. </p>

         <h4>Chapter 45</h4>
         <p>They laid still for what seemed like a long time, then James peeled himself off and cool
            air touched her damp skin. He buried his head into his drawn-up knees.</p>
         <p>“What’s wrong?” she asked</p>
         <p>He shot her a pained look. “You have a hickey on your neck. Guess Cal didn't get the
            same lecture.”</p>
         <p>She touched her collarbone, the spot where Caleb sucked the longest. “It's just a
            hickey. It doesn’t mean anything.”</p>
         <p>Nothing compared to what she just experienced. She touched his back, but he scooted
            forward, telling her the hickey stood for much more—and she knew it</p>
         <p>“That makes me mad for Cal—and angry with him for getting to do what he wants when I got
            a warning.” He faced her, his eyes vacant. “You should go.”</p>
         <p>“Go?”</p>
         <p>“That’s what I said. G.O. Go.” He pulled on jeans then retrieved a cigar box from the
            top drawer of his dresser. He stuck a blunt between his lips.</p>
         <p>Her heart sputtered. She caught his gaze through the mirror. “You’re doing this on
            purpose.”</p>
         <p>“Doing what? Put some fucking clothes on.”</p>
         <p>“This is how you respond when you're hurt. I've seen you pull this crap on Caleb a
            hundred times.”</p>
         <p>Reluctant to get out of bed, she grabbed a tee off the floor. A loud shattering made her
            jump, and she yanked the cotton material past her eyes.</p>
         <p>Sharp angles of glass were all that remained of the mirror. Blood dripped from James’
            knuckles as he gripped the edge of the dresser. She rushed to inspect his hand. For a
            second, he tolerated her, then stomped into the bathroom. He returned with his hand
            wrapped in a towel, snatched the cigar box, then headed to the sofa. Like a zombie, she
            followed.</p>
         <p>“You’re scaring me.” She climbed onto his lap.</p>
         <p>“Then leave. I know you hate to see me get high.” He lit the joint and held the smoke in
            until he coughed. “We’re done.”</p>
         <p>“Done?” The word sounded foreign. “You just told me you loved me.”</p>
         <p>“A guy will say anything to get laid.”</p>
         <p>“You don’t mean that.” Her stomach churned. “Kiss me.”</p>
         <p>Her attempt to chase down his lips turned into a desperate peck on his cheek.</p>
         <p>“Cassie, stop.” He rested his head against the cushion. “I can't do this anymore. I want
            someone I know is mine. I need something normal. You know, watching TV and stuff.”</p>
         <p>“TV.” It sounded ludicrous coming from him. “You want to watch TV… with who? Emily?” Her
            heart would beat out of her chest if he didn’t take those words back. “You’re not
            supposed to be in a relationship, remember?”</p>
         <p>His eyebrows rose, but he shrugged. “I don't want this anymore.” He brought his arm over
            his eyes. “Don’t make me force you to leave.”</p>
         <p>She tugged his elbow until he lowered his arm, then linked her fingers through his. “You
            can’t tell me you don't want me.”</p>
         <p>“I don't want you.” The words rolled easily from his mouth, his gaze on hers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cassie slid off his knee and stumbled into the bathroom. She slammed the door. Her
            clothes lay beside the tub, like nothing changed.</p>
         <p>James didn’t acknowledge her when she stepped out. A bottle sat on the coffee table in
            front of him.</p>
         <p>“Great, James. Get wasted. That’s what you’re good at.” She stomped past him into the
            late morning sun.</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>For the first time, she was glad her house was empty. She laid across the coffee table,
            the cool wood soothing. Its form solid enough to keep her from drowning. She sobbed
            until exhausted, and fell asleep.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Cassie. Cassie, are you all right?” Caleb peered down at her. “Your front door was
            open—and you're sleeping on the table.”</p>
         <p>She inched up, then deflated as the morning’s events injected a fresh jolt of
            misery.</p>
         <p>Caleb sat on the sofa and pulled her onto his knees. “Shh. You’re okay. What
            happened?”</p>
         <p>“I got in a fight with my mom,” she said, though she had no idea if her mom was in town.
            “What time is it?”</p>
         <p>“Almost one?” Caleb rubbed her back. “Wait here.” He padded down the hall and returned
            with a damp cloth and a glass of water. He dabbed the cloth to her face and produced a
            couple of aspirins from his pocket. “Here.”</p>
         <p>She sniffled. “You're good at this.”</p>
         <p>“I’m considering a career in medicine. I got into Notre Dame.”</p>
         <p>It was something she should have known, but they’d never discussed plans after high
            school. All they did this summer was party. The real world evaporated.</p>
         <p>Although she just woke up, she yawned. “Can we go to the pool house? I don't want to
            stay in this empty place.”</p>
         <p>“Sure,” he said, “but James might show up.”</p>
         <p>Cassie choked back a sob. Did Emily comfort James somewhere like Caleb comforted her?
            “Do you know where he is?”</p>
         <p>“I haven’t heard from him since the other night.” Caleb sighed, an all too familiar
            sound. “It's never good when he disappears.” </p>
      </chapter>
      <chapter>
         <h4>Chapter 46</h4>
         <p>James stared at the ceiling. What was wrong with him? No matter what his heart said,
            Cassie was Caleb’s girlfriend, not his. Physical proof of that shouldn't rattle him like
            it did. It was a hickey on her neck. Hell, there were worse places he could have
            discovered one.</p>
         <p>He stuck the bottle between his legs and unscrewed the lid with his good hand. Bacardi.
            The liquid burned, but he gulped down half. A lot, even for him. With Caleb tangled up
            in Cassie, no one would stop him. They were probably snuggled together this very
            moment.</p>
         <p>He told Cassie he loved her. What the hell did he know about love?</p>
         <p>Forgetting—that, he was good at.</p>
         <p>After the first few gulps his throat stopped protesting and the alcohol tasted better.
            He lit another blunt then gave the coffee table a savage kick. It landed on its top with
            a loud thump. One of its legs toppled over in an anti-climactic finale.</p>
         <p>Kicking it wasn’t as cathartic as he’d hoped, and he’d crushed his cigar box.</p>
         <p>He set the Bacardi on the floor, a challenging task with the rum kicking in, then booted
            the table against the wall instead of righting it. It splintered into an unfixable
            mess.</p>
         <p>His drug paraphernalia lay scattered across the floor. Dropping down, he bumped the sofa
            back. A pill bottle peeked out from under the upholstered skirt. The opaque container
            rattled when he shook it.</p>
         <p>He didn’t bother reading the label. It didn't matter. There ought to be enough of them
            to knock him on his ass until tomorrow night, or school started, if he was lucky.</p>
         <p>***</p>
         <p>Cassie stretched against Caleb under the blanket on the pool house sofa. He didn’t press
            for details. Instead, he chose to close the curtains and play soft music. If he was
            trying to soothe her, it worked. She drifted to sleep, settled against his ribs.</p>
         <p>When she woke again, it was late afternoon. Rain pelted the windows and hammered the
            roof. What was James doing now? Was he somewhere warm and dry? A loud growl escaped her
            stomach, a reminder she hadn’t eaten.</p>
         <p>“Hungry?” Caleb whispered in her ear. “I told my mom you weren’t feeling well, so she
            made her famous soup.”</p>
         <p>Cassie shuffled to the window and stared into the gloomy day. Elizabeth probably wanted
            to poison her. She would have to explain, in front of Caleb, how she ended up in the
            upstairs bedroom—with James.</p>
         <p>Her day couldn’t get much worse.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Both Caleb’s parents were in the kitchen. Great. She hardly met his father and he’d get
            to witness her humiliation. But Elizabeth didn’t launch into a rant about the previous
            morning. Smiling, she abandoned her place at the stove to grab the blanket they used as
            an umbrella.</p>
         <p>“Cassie.” David’s knife rhythmically thudded against their Illinois-shaped chopping
            board. “We heard you were under the weather, so Elizabeth whipped up a batch of chicken
            soup.” His voice held no disgust, only concern.</p>
         <p>Cassie pushed one of the stools closer to Caleb, then slouched against him. Elizabeth
            didn’t tell anyone what she saw. James had been right.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth gave Caleb an affectionate hug, then laid the back of her hand across Cassie’s
            forehead. “I hope nothing bad happened?”</p>
         <p>“Just an argument with my mom.” Cassie stared at the marble top. “Caleb shouldn’t have
            mentioned it.”</p>
         <p>He shrugged. “I thought the soup would help. It always makes James better. Or maybe it's
            the way my mom babies him when he's sick.”</p>
         <p>“James needs to be babied sometimes,” Elizabeth said in her soft tone reserved for
            James. She placed a steamy bowl on the marble. “Go ahead, Cassie. Try some broth.”</p>
         <p>The soup was hot, but good, with the perfect amount of seasoning. She consumed a few
            mouthfuls when Caleb’s phone vibrated. She forced herself to swallow.</p>
         <p>“What’s up.” Caleb offered his usual guy greeting.</p>
         <p>“Is that your brother?” Elizabeth said, “ask him if he’s hungry.”</p>
         <p>Caleb waved her off. “I can’t hear you,” he said into the phone, then hopped off the
            stool and paced across the kitchen. He faced the wall, the palm of his hand against his
            ear. “I’ve got to go,” he said when he turned around.</p>
         <p>David looked up from stirring his sauce. "What’s going on?”</p>
         <p>“James’ car broke down. I have to get him.” He pulled his keys from the hook and rushed
            out of the kitchen.</p>
         <p>Cassie remained on the stool. James probably got busted for drinking and driving and
            needed a bailout. She would be the last person he wanted to see.</p>
         <p>“Thanks for the soup.” Her spongy knees felt weak as she left the kitchen, after
            Caleb.</p>
         <p>He waited in the front entrance, his thumbs flying over his phone. “Get in the car,” he
            said, when she approached. “I might need your help.”</p>
         <p>*</p>
         <p>“Fucking, James.” Caleb punched the steering wheel. “He's completely out of it. I
            couldn't understand a word he said.”</p>
         <p>The first tinges of fear tightened her lungs. “Is he alright?”</p>
         <p>“He’s scared, Cassie.” Sweat glistened on Caleb’s temple. “Scared enough to call
            me.”</p>
         <p>The car ride didn’t help her stomach. When the mustang squealed around the corner where
            Saint Ambrose stood, Cassie caught her breath. They were headed to his apartment. The
            one he threw her out of.</p>
         <p>“You know where he lives?” she blurted out.</p>
         <p>“Of course, I do.” Caleb screeched to a stop in front of James’ house. He cut the engine
            and swung the door open. “The question is, how do you know where we are?”</p>
         <p>He got out of the car, leaving her open-mouthed and speechless.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>By the time she reached the back entrance, rain soaked through her clothing. Caleb
            pounded the door with both fists, rattling the square of glass.</p>
         <p>She pressed her back against the siding, under the eaves. “I can explain.”</p>
         <p>“For fuck sakes, Cassie.” Caleb stopped pounding. “Just help me get in the house. Check
            the windows.”</p>
         <p>“Are you sure he’s here?” James’ car sat in the driveway, but the entire house was in
            darkness. He could be anywhere. “Maybe Alexa picked him up.” Or Emily.</p>
         <p>Caleb rested his forehead against the door. “According to his phone, he’s here.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Tall grasses grew along the side of the house. She pushed them aside and rapped on the
            window. When she got no answer, she tried to slide the glass. The window refused to
            budge. Same with the next one. She wiped mud away with the bottom of James’ T-shirt, but
            inside was darker than outside and offered no clues.</p>
         <p>A loud crack shook the house. She scrambled to her feet and raced to the back stoop. The
            door hung lopsided on its remaining hinge, the basement an ominous black hole. Hair rose
            on her arms. Kicking James’ door in was rash, even for Caleb. She descended into the
            darkness, the stairs two at a time.</p>
         <p>Caleb stood in the middle of James’ apartment, silhouetted by evening sky. “Where’s the
            damn light switch?”</p>
         <p>Glass crunched under her shoes, as she passed James’ bed to hit the switch. Proof she’d
            been inside. She didn’t have time to dwell on it.</p>
         <p>James lay slumped against the wall, next to the bathroom door. Still shirtless, his
            chest and lips were wet with foam, his jeans, undone. Under him the carpet was a mess of
            blood and vomit. The towel he used as a Band-Aid lay a few feet away, covered in red. He
            still held his phone.</p>
         <p>“Cassie! Call 911.” Caleb dropped to his knees and pressed two fingers against James’
            wrist. “I’m not getting a pulse.”</p>
         <p>She crumpled to the floor as Caleb laid James flat and tipped his head. Using his baby
            finger, he scooped foam from James’ mouth, then grabbed his shoulders and shook. “Wake
            up.”</p>
         <p>James’ head rolled back, lifeless and limp.</p>
         <p>“CASSIE,” Caleb shouted, “911.”</p>
         <p>Cassie clawed her phone from her pocket. The device slipped from her grasp. She
            scrambled for it then punched in the numbers.</p>
         <p>“911.” The emergency dispatch answered. “What is your emergency?”</p>
         <p>“Our friend is unconscious,” Cassie blurted out.</p>
         <p>“Calm down.” The operator’s voice was firm. “Does he have a pulse?”</p>
         <p>“Pulse,” she yelled at Caleb, “can you find his pulse?”</p>
         <p>Tears streamed down Caleb’s cheeks. “I don't know. Fuck.” He clasped his fingers in
            front of him as if in prayer.</p>
         <p>“Check again. The carotid one,” she echoed the dispatcher’s words, “it’s in his
            neck.”</p>
         <p>“I know where it is.” Caleb brought his fingers to James’ neck. He repositioned them. An
            eternity passed with each second, then a tiny smile tweaked Caleb’s lip. “He has a
            pulse. Its weak. But it's there.” He shook James again, softer this time. “James.
            Breathe for me, man.”</p>
         <p>James gurgled. Both a horrible and wonderful sound. Caleb slumped back.</p>
         <p>“He has a pulse,” Cassie repeated to the operator. “He’s making noise, like he’s
            drowning. Caleb, put him on his…”</p>
         <p>Caleb looked at her, expectant.</p>
         <p>“What?” she said into the phone. “Lay him on his left side. Here. You talk.” She crawled
            to Caleb and handed over her phone.</p>
         <p>Edging backward, she ended up on James’ bed. Too terrified for tears, she hugged his
            pillow. A prescription bottle rolled against her thigh. It was empty.</p>
         <p>“Caleb.” She tossed him the container.</p>
         <p>“Jesus. Xanax. Who in the hell prescribed these?” Caleb recited the label to the 911
            operator then huddled next to James. “I feel so fucking helpless.”</p>
         <p>She buried her head into the pillow. It took a second to process the screaming sound of
            sirens came from right outside the house.</p>
         <p>“Go lead them in here,” Caleb said, “I’m not leaving him.”</p>
         <p>The paramedic’s followed her down the stairs. From James’ mattress, she peeked through
            her fingers as Caleb stepped away, allowing them to strap James’ to a gurney.</p>
         <p>This is why people think you have a death wish, she wanted to scream, but all the energy
            had drained out of her.</p>
         <p>If he died, she would be the last one to see him alive. God. If he died.</p>
         <p>The paramedics balked at Caleb’s attempts to ride along, and there was no friendly cop
            to suggest it might be a good idea. In the end, James made the trip alone, leaving the
            spot where he lay a quagmire of bodily fluids and muddy boot prints. Voices echoed up
            the stairway until there was nothing but silence, the small apartment cavernous in their
            absence.</p>
         <p>Caleb stumbled into the bathroom and shut the door. The sound of him retching twisted
            her stomach. At least if she puked, not much would come up. She laid back on the bed,
            the room spinning around her.</p>
         <p>The bathroom door opened. Caleb leaned against the door frame, one hand behind his back.
            He aged ten years in the last twenty minutes.</p>
         <p>Wanting comfort, she sat up and waited for Caleb to do his thing; tell her James would
            be alright—that she would be alright. But his eyes were hollow. He brought his hand into
            view. Hanging limply from his fingers were her bra and shirt. The ones she wore to bed
            last night. His bed. Last night at the pool house when she made out with him.</p>
         <p>She gasped, a reflexive action to something that should be bad, but she didn’t care
            anymore. James could be dead. Her James.</p>
         <p>“I wondered why you were wearing one of his band shirts,” Caleb said. “I thought it
            might be one he left at the pool house. I assumed you were too smart to be that obvious.
            Is he the reason you jumped out of my bed so early this morning?”</p>
         <p>She nodded, the truth liberating.</p>
         <p>“Did you tell him you spent the night with me?”</p>
         <p>“We didn't really discuss it.”</p>
         <p>Caleb’s eyes widened, his mouth twisted. “He better be okay, Cassie.” He tossed her
            stuff at her, they landed at her feet.</p>
         <p>“Get out,” he said when she failed to move. “I'm going to the hospital, and I'm not
            leaving you in his apartment.”</p>
         <p>“T-Take me with you.” She needed to see him. “He’ll want me there.”</p>
         <p>His face reddened. “Stay the fuck away from him. For the love of God, I warned you. He
            can't deal with this.”</p>
         <p>Caleb had been right, of course. James couldn’t handle her. She wanted him to pick her
            over everything else, then when he tried to, she was too scared to let go of the tiny
            bit of security she had with Caleb, to give James a chance. She made him miserable. She
            made him cry.</p>
         <p>“Now.” Caleb stood by the door, an irrefutable hint to leave, to vanish from their
            lives.</p>
         <p>“What about us?” He was the first guy she slept with and had been her friend if nothing
            else.</p>
         <p>“Us?” He gave her a weird chuckle. “There is no us. Get out.”</p>
         <p>The words resounded in her heart. There had been no them since they picked up James from
            Tracy’s that first night, only now it was official.</p>
         <p>Chin up, she waltzed past Caleb and climbed the steps, out of their lives. Outside, the
            air turned crisp. The first taste of fall. She headed north instead of going home.</p>
         <p>Caleb’s car sped past. He screeched to a stop at the corner, then peeled around the
            curb, the old church obscuring her view.</p>
         <p>Pulling out her phone, she scrolled for Emily's number.</p>
         <p>“Hey, Emily.” She texted. “Come pick me up?”</p>
