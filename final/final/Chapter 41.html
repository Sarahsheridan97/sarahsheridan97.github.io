         <h4>Chapter 41</h4>
      </div>
      <p>It was late afternoon when James returned. He crept around the TV and stood blinking
         at
         the sofa. Caleb lay asleep; Cassie tucked protectively under his arm. The scene made
         the
         conversation he practiced all day, pointless. Sighing, he dropped into the chair and
         lit
         a cigarette.</p>
      <p>Cassie’s shorts rode high on her thighs, her lips parted in sleep. He looked away
         and
         exhaled smoke. If she’d been by herself, he could have watched her forever. As it
         was,
         seeing her snuggled against Caleb gave him a headache. Or maybe heartache.</p>
      <p>So, this was jealousy—the desire to wake up your best friend by breaking his nose.
         He
         ground out his cigarette and cranked the volume on his earbuds. With one hand against
         his stomach, he let himself drift away.</p>
      <p>A thump on his knee jerked him awake. Cassie sat, arm stretched toward him, lips moving.
         He pulled his earbuds out.</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry,” she said in an exaggerated whisper, “I didn’t mean to startle you.”</p>
      <p>“You didn’t feckin startle me.” It came out ruder than intended. And louder. His eyes
         flicked to Cal.</p>
      <p>She pointed to the overflowed ashtray beside him. “How long have you been here?”</p>
      <p>The carnage of half-smoked cigarettes told a story he didn’t remember living—and didn’t
         care too. He shrugged.</p>
      <p>Bedhead suited her. Sexy swoops framed her face, the sun-bleached ends platinum. She
         stretched her legs out, long, tan and inviting. His memory may be jacked, but he would
         never forget the feel of those legs, wrapped around him on his bathroom floor.</p>
      <p>Their eyes met. She lifted her brows, then sucked her bottom lip.</p>
      <p>Groaning, he leaned forward. Perfect. They couldn’t be in the same room, without
         reliving what it felt like to be inside her. He motioned toward the sofa. “I see things
         have been mended in Cassie-land.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah. We’re good.” She smiled too broadly.</p>
      <p>“How’s he doing?”</p>
      <p>“Better. He said he needed sleep, so he took some pills from your room.”</p>
      <p>Shit. Caleb found his Valium. He’ll receive wrath for that later, but right now Cal’s
         breaths were steady, and he appeared peaceful. It would be a while before he woke.</p>
      <p>“Man, it's hotter than hell out today.” Standing, he yanked his shirt off and patted
         dry. He tossed it toward the growing pile of laundry, on his way to the bathroom.</p>
      <p>“Going swimming?” Cassie asked when he came out, wearing trunks, a towel around his
         neck.</p>
      <p>“No, shopping.” He waltzed past her but paused at the open door. “Don’t ask obvious
         questions to make conversation.”</p>
      <p>“My, aren’t you in a fantastic mood.”</p>
      <p>“If you want to discuss my mood, join me.” He closed the door behind him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James opened his eyes underwater. With any luck, the sting of the chlorine would burn
         the image of Cassie and Cal snuggled together, off his retinas.</p>
      <p>Movement in the shallow end surprised him. He broke the surface and grinned. Cassie
         sat
         on the ledge, feet in the water, arms crossed. She’d changed into a bikini top but
         didn’t look happy.</p>
      <p>He swam toward her, thinking of an excuse for his current rudeness. His arm brushed
         her
         leg as he leaned his elbows on the pavers.</p>
      <p>“Sorry I was rude.” He smiled up at her, but she refused to meet his eyes. “I said
         I was
         sorry. Look at me.” He caught her chin, needing her to see him.</p>
      <p>She jerked out of his grasp. “Don’t touch me. I only came out here to tell you the
         other
         night was a mistake.”</p>
      <p>The words entered his brain, ricocheted, and exploded. A mistake. She’d still wanted
         him
         this morning, he couldn’t be too late. Water splashed as he tried to worm his way
         between her legs, to get closer.</p>
      <p>“Stop.” She pushed him away. “Caleb might be watching. We talked.”</p>
      <p>“What did you talk about? The weather? The Cubs?” Me. “Be more specific, Cassandra.”</p>
      <p>“About me and him.” She glanced toward the pool house. “What’s gotten into you? It's
         not
         like you give a crap.”</p>
      <p>Defeated, he let his arms fall limp to his sides, then laid his head in her lap and
         inhaled.</p>
      <p>“You’re getting my shorts wet,” she protested, but made no effort to remove him.
         Instead, she stroked his hair. “James. I don’t understand you. One minute you’re pushing
         me away, the next you’re like a little boy in need of my attention.”</p>
      <p>“I need more than attention.” He maneuvered between her knees and encircled her waist
         with his arms. This time she allowed it. She leaned into him, a missing piece to his
         convoluted puzzle.</p>
      <p>He buried his face against her chest. “I like the way you smell.”</p>
      <p>The confession made her chuckle.</p>
      <p>“Don’t laugh at me, angel.”</p>
      <p>“Sorry.” She inched back and looked down at him, a steady gaze that didn’t waver.
         “It’s
         just, so not what I expected you to say.”</p>
      <p>He could drown in the blueness of her eyes, and worse, wanted to. Her brows rose.
         Enough
         to tell him he was under examination—and exposing too much. Heat stung his neck, and
         he
         lowered his head. “What are you doing?”</p>
      <p>“If I can see your eyes, I can read your emotions.”</p>
      <p>He wanted to tell her, only Cal could read his mind, but when he looked up, his lips
         found hers instead. He placed a gentle kiss on them. Cassie gasped against his mouth.
         Her posture stiffened, but she didn’t pull back.</p>
      <p>“Read this,” he whispered, kissing harder.</p>
      <p>She emitted a tiny sound that hummed lyrically in his ears. He wanted to hear that
         sound
         again. He gripped her thighs and pulled her into the water, pressing her against the
         side of the pool.</p>
      <p>“And read this,” he said, pushing his hardness against her, loving the way she groaned
         into his mouth. So, what if Caleb saw them? He craved the feel of her body. She was
         his
         solace, and he wanted to go home.</p>
      <p>“Stop.” She shoved him back. “I can’t think straight. How do you always do this to
         me?”</p>
      <p>All the things he wanted to say jammed in his throat, leaving him sputtering. Sleeping
         with her was not a mistake. He wanted her. Enough to tell Caleb how he felt. They
         were
         brothers. They’d work this out.</p>
      <p>The rattling gate warned them their time alone had ended.</p>
      <p>She waved a finger at him. “Friends, James. It’s better for everyone this way.”</p>
      <p>He dove under the surface. Based on the way she kissed, it wasn’t better for either
         of
         them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>By the time he broke the water in the deep end, Cassie climbed out, and Allison and
         Emily were poolside. Emily’s stare burrowed through him as he tread water.</p>
      <p>“W-What are you guys doing here?” Cassie wrapped a towel around her middle. Crimson
         highlighted her cheeks, bright enough to notice from the deep end.</p>
      <p>“Looking for you.” Allison’s frown reached him, across the ripples. “Where’s Caleb?”</p>
      <p>James swam to the shallow end and ascended the steps. “Cal’s sleeping,” he answered
         as
         Cassie fumbled for words.</p>
      <p>He stretched across a chaise and closed his eyes. Someone sat by his feet, most likely
         not Cassie. He gave himself a minute of delusional solitude before checking. Cassie
         and
         Allie were on their own chairs. Emily leered at him from the foot of his chaise. She
         held a Mickey of Tito’s.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been texting you all day.” Allison extended her phone as if Cassie asked for
         proof. “Don’t you ever check your messages? What’s going on over here?”</p>
      <p>“Nothing,” Cassie said, a little too fast. “I’m glad you guys came over. I’m so
         bored.”</p>
      <p>James sat upright and straddled the chair. “I’m bored too. I’ll go rouse, Cal. See
         you
         guys in a bit.”</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As expected, Caleb was sleeping. James crept to the bathroom and turned the shower
         on.
         Ten minutes later, when he stepped out, Caleb had moved to a chair.</p>
      <p>“Have a good nap?” James asked, as he rummaged through the folded laundry that replaced
         the mound of dirty clothes he gathered earlier. “I heard you found my Valium.”</p>
      <p>Caleb got up slowly, then stretched. “I took one and flushed the rest.”</p>
      <p>That had been a full bottle of freshly acquired pills, and they weren’t easy to come
         by.
         But knowing better than to continue the conversation, James held up a pair of green
         swimming trunks. “Can I wear these? I think they’re yours.”</p>
      <p>Caleb shrugged so James stepped into them. “Cassie told me you two talked.”</p>
      <p>“We made up. It's all good.”</p>
      <p>The trunks hung off James’ hips. Eyes downward, he pulled the string tighter. “Cassie’s
         friends are here,” he said, after he secured the knot.</p>
      <p>Caleb shuffled into the kitchen. “I noticed. What do they want?”</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty sure I know what Emily wants, but that chick’s not worth the problem.”
         He
         frowned. “You’re moving pretty slow. Are you up for company?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t have to drink.” Caleb picked a piece of white paper off the kitchen table
         and
         scanned it. He plopped onto a bistro chair. “I’ll hang with Cassie and watch you
         self-destruct.”</p>
      <p>Self-destruction sounded great. Fortunately, Caleb missed the acid stashed in the
         back
         of the dresser. James scratched his chin. “How much damage can I possibly do to myself
         when Mom is in the house, eighty feet away?”</p>
      <p>“You’re in luck.” Caleb lifted the paper. “Mom's at a friend’s house for some sort
         of
         candle and wine party. She might spend the night. He crumpled the note and threw it
         at
         James. “The house is empty. Screw Emily on the dining room table if you want.”</p>
      <p>“I don't want to.” The note fell to the floor at James’ feet. “If it looks like that’s
         where my evening’s headed, stop me.” </p><a href="../chapter.html">Next Chapter</a><div><a href="../finalv4.html">Back to Contents</a></div>
