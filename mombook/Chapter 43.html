      <p>James returned five minutes later with a blanket from the pool house. He spread it
         across Caleb, grabbed the vodka and headed toward Cassie, still by the fire.</p>
      <p>“Cal’s out.” He took a drink.</p>
      <p>“Stop,” she said, “Why do you have to drink so much?”</p>
      <p>“I’m not that drunk, and ha. I forgot about your, ‘I can’t drink or do drugs if I
         want
         to hang with you’, Rule.” He set the bottle down. “I want to hang with you.”</p>
      <p> He crossed the grass to the leafy coverage of the pergola. The long vines, after
         such a
         hot summer, hung almost to the ground. After a minute, she followed.</p>
      <p>As he predicted. She couldn’t resist him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James lounged against the thick corner post of the pergola. He spread his arms wide.
         “Isn’t this where the whole mess began? In Caleb’s backyard?</p>
      <p>“It is,” she allowed, “but you weren’t high that night.”</p>
      <p>“Some drugs help you understand what you want.” He caught her gaze. “I know what I
         want.”</p>
      <p>Responding to his honesty was an art she never mastered. With an embarrassed giggle,
         she
         stepped back. From his frown, he wasn’t thrilled with her reaction.</p>
      <p>Fisting the bottom of her shirt, he tugged her closer. “Friends aren’t supposed to
         laugh
         at each other.”</p>
      <p>His lips graced her neck, tasting before sucking. Her shoulders relaxed. She tilted
         her
         head, allowing his mouth to skip across her collarbone. “Friends aren't supposed to
         kiss,” she managed.</p>
      <p>All night long she felt dead, but now she was alive. Even the air seemed different.
         Charged. She closed her eyes. Her body tingled and her breathing deepened, but she
         didn’t touch him. As usual, James was right. She was being unfair to Caleb. He was
         her
         stand-in. The guy she wanted, who stoked her pulse, stood in front of her.
         Untouchable.</p>
      <p>“Come with me.” Still holding her shirt, James stepped toward the house.</p>
      <p>“I can’t.” God, she would let him lead her straight into traffic if she wasn’t
         careful.</p>
      <p>He released her and surrendered. “I get it. Friends. No more lips on you. I want to
         show
         you something.”</p>
      <p>“And it’s not your penis?”</p>
      <p>He laughed, a sound she could drown in. “It’s not my penis. I swear it.”</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>“Do you know where you are?” James leaned against the bedroom door, blinking under
         the
         brightness of the ceiling light.</p>
      <p>She had never been in the room at the end of their hall, but the big Irish flag
         dominating one wall offered a clue.</p>
      <p>“Your bedroom?” She looked around for added conformation.</p>
      <p>Unlike his apartment, evidence of his past lay scattered. Framed photos looked homeless,
         leaning against each other or upside down. Stacks of books teetered like an unruly
         game
         of Jenga. Trophies and ribbons littered the dresser top, all covered with an inch
         of
         dust.</p>
      <p>Someone ate his entire childhood and threw it up in this room, never to touch it
         again.</p>
      <p>James’ gaze lingered at the window. He rubbed his arm, where the snake tattoo resided.
         “It is my room,” he said, “but I’ve never spent the night in it.”</p>
      <p>“You used to sleep on Caleb’s floor.”</p>
      <p>He jerked his attention to her. “Who told you that?”</p>
      <p>“Caleb did,” she admitted. “It's okay, James, everyone has problems sleeping from
         time
         to time.”</p>
      <p>He sat on the edge of the bed and sighed. “Come over here.”</p>
      <p>She crept over, till her feet were between his, and her shins pressed the mattress.
         Wanting to comfort him, she allowed him to lay his head against her stomach.</p>
      <p>“Are you okay?” she asked, her hands in his hair. She squatted to get a look at his
         face. His pupils were still large.</p>
      <p>He scooted backward, toward the headboard and motioned for her to join him. “Teacht
         anseo.”</p>
      <p>She wanted nothing more than to crawl beside him and chase away his pain, but his
         bottoms rode dangerously low and her conscience cartwheeled.</p>
      <p>“Please.” He lay flat and brought his arm over his eyes. “I want to spend the night
         in
         here. I’d have taken you to my place if I wanted sex.”</p>
      <p>The misery in his voice cracked her resolve. Caleb was wrong; she would hurt James
         if
         she left. Besides, they were only sleeping. She turned the light off, then crawled
         across the bed to lie next to him. “What if Caleb searches for you?”</p>
      <p>“This is the last place he’d look.”</p>
      <p>His breathing evened out. It didn’t take long for her to drift off beside him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>James opened his eyes to the tricolor; the Irish flag and smiled. He did it; spent
         the
         night in his room. But he didn’t have time to enjoy the victory. The door opened.
         Elizabeth stood in the hallway, a large box in her arms.</p>
      <p>“James. You’re in here?” She stepped into the room and shut the door. “With a girl?”</p>
      <p>Cassie. She lay curled beside him. A chill shot down his spine.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth placed the box on the floor and crossed the room. “What are you doing in
         here?”</p>
      <p>“Sleeping,” he said as the tingle in his spine spread to his extremities, “God’s
         truth.”</p>
      <p>Cassie rolled onto her back, her eyes sleepy, until they drifted toward Elizabeth.
         Then
         they opened wide. Gasping, she scooted to the far side of the bed.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth also gasped. Her gaze locked on him. “Go home, Cassie,” she said, but her
         mouth lacked synchronicity with her words. “I need to talk to James. Alone.”</p>
      <p>“Look at her,” James demanded. He pulled the blanket from Cassie’s grasp. “She's fully
         dressed. We didn’t do anything.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth covered her eyes. “Pull up your shorts.”</p>
      <p>He jerked the trunks up and shook out his arms. His hands tingled. He must have made
         a
         noise because both Cassie and Elizabeth stared at him.</p>
      <p>“Are you okay?” The anger in Elizabeth’s face, softened. She was good at telling when
         he
         lost it, almost as good as Caleb. But Cassie remained clueless—and he wanted her to
         stay
         that way.</p>
      <p>He bumped Cassie’s shoulder with his. “Go home. I’ll take care of this.”</p>
      <p>Cassie paused then, head down, scampered past Elizabeth, out the door.</p>
      <p>“I told you. I didn’t touch her.” Caleb would kill him when he found this out.</p>
      <p>“But it’s okay for you to be half-naked in front of her?”</p>
      <p>This was going nowhere, fast. James floated to his feet and steadied himself against
         the
         solid wooden headboard. “Cassie’s not at fault. If you’re going to be mad at someone,
         hate me.”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth reached for him. “Why don’t you sit down for a bit?”</p>
      <p>He lurched back. “Don’t touch me.” He didn't plan to sit anywhere, not with Elizabeth.
         Not with anyone.</p>
      <p>She lowered her arm. “James. Breathe in, breathe out. Slow, steady breaths.”</p>
      <p>Fuck her and her grounding techniques. He didn't need a mother. Not his mother, not
         Caleb’s.</p>
      <p>But he needed Cal.</p>
      <p>He pressed his back flat against the wall. “Where’s my brother?”</p>
      <p>“In his room, sleeping.”</p>
      <p>“Are you going to tell him?”</p>
      <p>Elizabeth sunk onto the bedside. “I won’t. But Caleb can read you well. Even when
         things
         aren’t so obvious. You should be honest with him. Be honest with yourself.”</p>
      <p>He tried honesty with Cassie. It got him nowhere. “Am I dismissed?”</p>
      <p>“Let me make you some tea. James, please. We can talk.”</p>
      <p>He dodged for the door, before he confessed how badly he wanted Cassie, or collapsed
         into Elizabeth’s arms, longing for his own mother. The dead one, he didn't want.</p>
      <p>What he needed, was to get obliterated. Before his head exploded. </p><a href="../index.html">Back to list</a></body>
